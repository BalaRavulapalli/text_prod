In fact, rainforest soils are nutrient-poor because nutrients are not stored in them for very long. The heavy rains that occur in rainforests wash organic material from the soil. Although decomposition occurs rapidly in the hot, moist conditions, many of the dead, fallen leaves and other organic detritus are swept away before releasing all of their nutrients. In addition, rainwater seeps into the ground and leaches away nutrients.

ERROR:root:payload: "you can review content from crash course organic chemistry with the crash course app available now for android and ios devices hi i'm daboki chakravarti and welcome to crash course organic chemistry to communicate with each other insects often use organic chemistry instead of using words they secrete compounds that can mean hey you're cute or follow this path for food or even back off you're gonna get hurt if you come any closer soldier termites for example defend their nests by secreting a toxic chemical that wards off invaders just fine but when they use these chemical weapons they have to make sure they don't also hurt their own nest mates turns out the worker termites in the nest have an enzyme that allows them to reduce the chemical from its toxic form to another harmless form and in this reaction only the double bond that is conjugated with the carbonyl is reduced specifically the soldier termites toxin has a functional group called an enone and the worker termites enzyme selectively removes the alkene from that functional group enones can undergo a reaction called conjugate addition that simple alkenes can't and this reaction makes the enone toxic to invaders let's see why and explore some more reactions and properties of enolates [Music] in the previous episode we learned about aldol reactions where two simple carbonyl compounds combine into a larger one specifically we explored what happened when the two reactant molecules were the same but if we join two different carbonyl compounds like an enol or enolate and a different aldehyde or ketone it's called a crossed aldol reaction with cross aldo reactions it's very important to choose the carbonyls carefully otherwise we end up with a horrible mess of different products generally it's a good idea to use an enolizable ketone with alpha hydrogens and a non-enolizable aldehyde this works well because first only the ketone can form an enol or enolate and become the nucleophile in the reaction and second aldehydes are more reactive than ketones because they're usually less hindered at the carbonyl carbon and less stabilized by inductive effects so we minimize the chances of a ketone reacting with itself it also helps to have the aldehyde in excess because that way there's much less chance of a ketone molecule bumping into another ketone molecule at all the mechanism for a cross-aldol reaction looks like what we've been doing in the last two episodes we start with deprotonation of the enolyzable ketone assuming we're working under basic conditions the next step is for the enolate anion to do its nucleophile thing and attack the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde then we pull a hydrogen off some nearby water to form the hydroxyl and we have the aldol product remember these protons in between the alcohol and the carbonyl are pretty acidic and we still have basic conditions so off goes a proton and now we have the enolate of the aldol product finally the hydroxide is eliminated through an e1cb elimination and we're left with an unsaturated carbonyl compound honestly there's nothing really new here except we use two different reactants so let's throw something else into the mix making an enolate from methyl isopropyl ketone it has more than one alpha hydrogen and when we mix it with base we could form two different enolates so which one forms or is it both to figure it out let's take a moment to review zaitsev's rule in elimination reactions that form alkenes we tend to form the alkene product that we get by removing a hydrogen from the carbon with the fewest hydrogens or to put it another way we mostly get the more substituted alkene product we can use similar logic here to figure out the enolate product if we remove a proton from the more substituted alpha carbon in the methyl isopropyl ketone we get an enolate with a more substituted carbon-carbon double bond this is a lower energy product and therefore more thermodynamically stable so we call it the thermodynamic product if we remove a proton from the less substituted alpha carbon in the methyl isopropyl ketone we get an enolate with a less substituted carbon-carbon double bond this product forms more quickly because the hydrogen being removed is more sterically accessible there's less stuff around it so we call it the kinetic product so we have one enolate that's lower in energy but form more slowly and one that's higher in energy but form more quickly which one we get depends on the reaction conditions at low temperatures we don't have enough energy to get over the larger energy barrier but we can get over the smaller energy barrier for the quick forming less stable higher energy enolate the kinetic product at higher temperatures there's enough energy to get over both energy barriers and to reverse the reaction so over time the slow forming more stable lower energy enolate forms the thermodynamic product we also need to take into account what base we're using to form the enolate say we have a bigger stronger sterically hindered base such as lithium diisopropyl amide or lda and the deprotonation step is rapid and irreversible in this case the kinetic product will be favored however with weaker bases like alkoxides the pka of the base and the enolate are close this means that the enolate can interconvert between the two forms so over time the more stable product wins and we end up with more of the thermodynamic product so to recap a strong base and a low temperature gives us the kinetic enolate a weaker base and higher temperature gives us the thermodynamic enolate okay now that we know how to puzzle through tricky enolate formation let's try a crossed aldol condensation with enolizable hydrogens on both carbonyl substrates i know earlier i said this could be a horrible mess of different products but there are some tricks we can use to keep things simple let's take it step by step we mentioned lda a moment ago and said it forms the enolate completely we're starting with methyl isopropyl ketone again and here's that lda nabbing one of the alpha protons to form the kinetic product then we add in an aldehyde and the enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon we're still under basic conditions which are non-aqueous so we can use a strong base like lda to finish up the reaction we toss some acid into the mix at the end to protonate the oxygen and cause elimination now there's another way to look at these aldol reactions backwards like we learned in episode 34 using retrosynthesis to figure out how to make something is a lot of what we do in organic chemistry retrosynthesis is a bit like cutting up a beautiful cake to figure out the decorations filling and ingredients so you can make the same cake yourself from scratch just don't try to taste your reactions so for example here's a cool compound we notice the structure contains an enone where an alkene is conjugated with a carbonyl like a ketone or aldehyde this is a dehydrated product that can come from an aldol condensation we can use retrosynthesis to reverse engineer it let's imagine cutting that carbon-carbon double bond with magic chemical scissors the part containing the carbonyl is the enolate we need to form and we just tack an oxygen onto the other part to figure out the carbonyl compound we need to attack we know which starting materials we need besides being fun to make enones can also be reagents and some interesting chemical reactions let's take a quick look at their structure they're often numbered based on the atoms in their conjugated system starting with the high priority oxygen atom looking at some resonance structures we can see that the four position is electrophilic which means it can be attacked by nucleophiles of course the carbonyl carbon is also electrophilic as they've been throughout this whole series and the known universe so there are two possibilities for an enone reaction there's one two nucleophilic addition where the nucleophile adds to the carbonyl carbon alternatively we could get one for nucleophilic addition also known as conjugate addition where it adds at the four position it's using the whole conjugated system to do the reaction and that's where it gets its name in one two addition the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon the pi electrons in that bond are shunted up to the oxygen which then picks up a proton to form a hydroxyl group fairly simple and familiar in the conjugate addition mechanism the nucleophile attacks the four position and the enolate that forms is stabilized by resonance because of this one of two things can happen next but the product is the same either way in one possible mechanism the oxygen is protonated and tautomerization gives the ketone in the other the alpha carbon picks up a proton to form the ketone directly we have two possibilities again this time the nucleophilic attack is kinetically favored at the carbonyl carbon meaning it's faster on the other hand the nucleophilic attack is thermodynamically favored at the alkene meaning it's more stable it turns out that conjugate addition reactions aren't unique to enones conjugated carboxylic acid derivatives can undergo this kind of reaction under the right conditions the substrate structure plays a big role in what reaction happens for example a nucleophile attacking an acid chloride is more likely to attack the carbonyl carbon the strongly electron withdrawing chlorine really polarizes the carbonyl carbon making it super attractive to nucleophiles and favoring one to addition but a nucleophile attacking an amide is headed for the four position the nitrogen has lone pairs that stabilize the molecule by resonance which makes the carbonyl less reactive and favors conjugate addition the nucleophile is even more important though at this point it's helpful to think of them in two categories hard nucleophiles and soft nucleophiles hardness and softness is related to charge and polarizability which we learned about in episode 11. think of hard nucleophiles as kind of like sharp weapons they're aggressive they're very electronegative relatively small and not very polarizable think fluorides alkoxides organolithiums and grignard reagents soft nucleophiles on the other hand are cuddly they say hey let's not fight let's hug it out instead they have lower electronegativity they're bigger more polarizable and sometimes neutrally charged think that sulfur compounds iodide ions and resonance stabilized enolates hard and soft nucleophiles do have hard and soft electrophile counterparts and we'll just touch on this topic briefly with our enone example all we need to know for now is that soft nucleophiles are more likely to react with soft electrophiles and hard nucleophiles are more likely to react with hard electrophiles i guess colors like to cuddle and fighters like to fight so when we have an enone with two electrophilic sites the carbonyl carbon is a harder electrophile because it's closer to the electron pulling oxygen while the carbon at the four position is much softer and based on that cuddling versus fighting pattern a hard nucleophile is more likely to give us the one two addition product while a soft nucleophile is more likely to give us the conjugate addition product in fact remember our termites from the intro the toxic chemical weapon of the soldier termites is an enone and because so many biological groups have thials which are soft nucleophiles the toxin causes biological upset thanks to conjugate addition reactions the inactivated toxin which forms after exposure to the worker termites enzyme doesn't have a double bond conjugated with the carbonyl group it's unreactive with soft nucleophiles like thials and our worker termites live to build another day not only that but conjugate addition of thials are part of our penicillin v synthesis too this step of our mold medicine map starts off with the ring compound we made in the last episode first we mix methoxide with hydrogen sulfide gas and the methoxide nabs a proton the newly formed bisulfide anion a soft nucleophile attacks the enone of the beta position to form the conjugate addition product after that we have a cleavage step methoxide which is a harder nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon when the electrons move down from the oxygen the ring cleaves to leave an ester group at one end of the molecule at the other end we have our leaving group and the protonation at nitrogen leaves us with an amide so overall dr chien used a conjugate addition reaction to add the sulfur atom needed for the penicillin ring in episode 31 we saw that the next step was hydrolysis of both the ester and the amide comparing that to the five-membered ring of penicillin we can see that this early step in the synthesis introduced all but one of these atoms but that was a real brain bender so we'll end this episode here this time we learned that a cross aldo reaction involves joining an enolizable ketone and an aldehyde kinetic and thermodynamic enolates form under different conditions soft nucleophiles are more likely to attack soft electrophiles and hard nucleophiles are more likely to attack hard electrophiles for now we're done with enols and enolates but not with penicillin next time we'll cover amines and learn how dr shien closed up that five-membered ring until next time thanks for watching this episode of crash course organic chemistry if you want to help keep all crash course free for everybody forever you can join our community on

ERROR:root:orig input: " you can review content from crash course organic chemistry with the crash course app available now for android and ios devices hi i'm daboki chakravarti and welcome to crash course organic chemistry to communicate with each other insects often use organic chemistry instead of using words they secrete compounds that can mean hey you're cute or follow this path for food or even back off you're gonna get hurt if you come any closer soldier termites for example defend their nests by secreting a toxic chemical that wards off invaders just fine but when they use these chemical weapons they have to make sure they don't also hurt their own nest mates turns out the worker termites in the nest have an enzyme that allows them to reduce the chemical from its toxic form to another harmless form and in this reaction only the double bond that is conjugated with the carbonyl is reduced specifically the soldier termites toxin has a functional group called an enone and the worker termites enzyme selectively removes the alkene from that functional group enones can undergo a reaction called conjugate addition that simple alkenes can't and this reaction makes the enone toxic to invaders let's see why and explore some more reactions and properties of enolates [Music] in the previous episode we learned about aldol reactions where two simple carbonyl compounds combine into a larger one specifically we explored what happened when the two reactant molecules were the same but if we join two different carbonyl compounds like an enol or enolate and a different aldehyde or ketone it's called a crossed aldol reaction with cross aldo reactions it's very important to choose the carbonyls carefully otherwise we end up with a horrible mess of different products generally it's a good idea to use an enolizable ketone with alpha hydrogens and a non-enolizable aldehyde this works well because first only the ketone can form an enol or enolate and become the nucleophile in the reaction and second aldehydes are more reactive than ketones because they're usually less hindered at the carbonyl carbon and less stabilized by inductive effects so we minimize the chances of a ketone reacting with itself it also helps to have the aldehyde in excess because that way there's much less chance of a ketone molecule bumping into another ketone molecule at all the mechanism for a cross-aldol reaction looks like what we've been doing in the last two episodes we start with deprotonation of the enolyzable ketone assuming we're working under basic conditions the next step is for the enolate anion to do its nucleophile thing and attack the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde then we pull a hydrogen off some nearby water to form the hydroxyl and we have the aldol product remember these protons in between the alcohol and the carbonyl are pretty acidic and we still have basic conditions so off goes a proton and now we have the enolate of the aldol product finally the hydroxide is eliminated through an e1cb elimination and we're left with an unsaturated carbonyl compound honestly there's nothing really new here except we use two different reactants so let's throw something else into the mix making an enolate from methyl isopropyl ketone it has more than one alpha hydrogen and when we mix it with base we could form two different enolates so which one forms or is it both to figure it out let's take a moment to review zaitsev's rule in elimination reactions that form alkenes we tend to form the alkene product that we get by removing a hydrogen from the carbon with the fewest hydrogens or to put it another way we mostly get the more substituted alkene product we can use similar logic here to figure out the enolate product if we remove a proton from the more substituted alpha carbon in the methyl isopropyl ketone we get an enolate with a more substituted carbon-carbon double bond this is a lower energy product and therefore more thermodynamically stable so we call it the thermodynamic product if we remove a proton from the less substituted alpha carbon in the methyl isopropyl ketone we get an enolate with a less substituted carbon-carbon double bond this product forms more quickly because the hydrogen being removed is more sterically accessible there's less stuff around it so we call it the kinetic product so we have one enolate that's lower in energy but form more slowly and one that's higher in energy but form more quickly which one we get depends on the reaction conditions at low temperatures we don't have enough energy to get over the larger energy barrier but we can get over the smaller energy barrier for the quick forming less stable higher energy enolate the kinetic product at higher temperatures there's enough energy to get over both energy barriers and to reverse the reaction so over time the slow forming more stable lower energy enolate forms the thermodynamic product we also need to take into account what base we're using to form the enolate say we have a bigger stronger sterically hindered base such as lithium diisopropyl amide or lda and the deprotonation step is rapid and irreversible in this case the kinetic product will be favored however with weaker bases like alkoxides the pka of the base and the enolate are close this means that the enolate can interconvert between the two forms so over time the more stable product wins and we end up with more of the thermodynamic product so to recap a strong base and a low temperature gives us the kinetic enolate a weaker base and higher temperature gives us the thermodynamic enolate okay now that we know how to puzzle through tricky enolate formation let's try a crossed aldol condensation with enolizable hydrogens on both carbonyl substrates i know earlier i said this could be a horrible mess of different products but there are some tricks we can use to keep things simple let's take it step by step we mentioned lda a moment ago and said it forms the

over both energy barriers and to reverse the reaction so over time the slow forming more stable lower energy enolate forms the thermodynamic product we also need to take into account what base we're using to form the enolate say we have a bigger stronger sterically hindered base such as lithium diisopropyl amide or lda and the deprotonation step is rapid and irreversible in this case the kinetic product will be favored however with weaker bases like alkoxides the pka of the base and the enolate are close this means that the enolate can interconvert between the two forms so over time the more stable product wins and we end up with more of the thermodynamic product so to recap a strong base and a low temperature gives us the kinetic enolate a weaker base and higher temperature gives us the thermodynamic enolate okay now that we know how to puzzle through tricky enolate formation let's try a crossed aldol condensation with enolizable hydrogens on both carbonyl substrates i know earlier i said a crossed aldol condensation with enolizable hydrogens on both carbonyl substrates could be a horrible mess of different products but there are some tricks we can use to keep things simple let's take it step by step we mentioned lda a moment ago and said lda forms the enolate completely we're starting with methyl isopropyl ketone again and here's that lda nabbing one of the alpha protons to form the kinetic product then we add in an aldehyde and the enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon we're still under basic conditions which are non-aqueous so we can use a strong base like lda to finish up the reaction we toss some acid into the mix at the end to protonate the oxygen and cause elimination now there's another way to look at these aldol reactions backwards like we learned in episode 34 using retrosynthesis to figure out how to make something is a lot of what we do in organic chemistry retrosynthesis is a bit like cutting up a beautiful cake to figure out the decorations filling and ingredients so you can make the same cake yourself from scratch just don't try to taste your reactions so for example here's a cool compound we notice the structure contains an enone where an alkene is conjugated with a carbonyl like a ketone or aldehyde the structure is a dehydrated product that can come from an aldol condensation we can use retrosynthesis to reverse engineer an aldol condensation let's imagine cutting that carbon-carbon double bond with magic chemical scissors the part containing the carbonyl is the enolate we need to form and we just tack an oxygen onto the other part to figure out the carbonyl compound we need to attack we know which starting materials we need besides being fun to make enones can also be reagents and some interesting chemical reactions let's take a quick look at enones's structure enones're often numbered based on the atoms in enones's conjugated system starting with the high priority oxygen atom looking at some resonance structures we can see that the four position is electrophilic which means the four position can be attacked by nucleophiles of course the carbonyl carbon is also electrophilic as the carbonyl carbon've been throughout this whole series and the known universe so there are two possibilities for an enone reaction there's one two nucleophilic addition where the nucleophile adds to the carbonyl carbon alternatively we could get one for nucleophilic addition also known as conjugate addition where the nucleophile adds at the four position the nucleophile's using the whole conjugated system to do the reaction and that's where the nucleophile gets the nucleophile's name in one two nucleophilic addition the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon the pi electrons in the carbonyl carbon are shunted up to the oxygen which then picks up a proton to form a hydroxyl group fairly simple and familiar in the conjugate addition mechanism the nucleophile attacks the four position and the enolate that forms is stabilized by resonance because of attacks one of two things can happen next but the product is the same either way in one possible mechanism the oxygen is protonated and tautomerization gives the ketone in the other the alpha carbon picks up a proton to form the ketone directly we have two possibilities again this time the nucleophilic attack is kinetically favored at the carbonyl carbon meaning the nucleophilic attack's faster on the other hand the nucleophilic attack is thermodynamically favored at the alkene meaning the nucleophilic attack's more stable it turns out that conjugate addition reactions aren't unique to enones conjugated carboxylic acid derivatives can undergo this kind of reaction under the right conditions the substrate structure plays a big role in what reaction happens for example a nucleophile attacking an acid chloride is more likely to attack the carbonyl carbon the strongly electron withdrawing chlorine really polarizes the carbonyl carbon making the carbonyl carbon super attractive to nucleophiles and favoring one to addition but a nucleophile attacking an amide is headed for the four position the nitrogen has lone pairs that stabilize the molecule by resonance which makes the carbonyl less reactive and favors conjugate addition the nucleophile is even more important though at this point it's helpful to think of the nucleophile in two categories hard nucleophiles and soft nucleophiles hardness and softness is related to charge and polarizability which we learned about in episode 11. think of hard nucleophiles as kind of like sharp weapons hard nucleophiles're aggressive hard nucleophiles're very electronegative relatively small and not very polarizable think fluorides alkoxides organolithiums and grignard reagents soft nucleophiles on the other hand are cuddly soft nucleophiles say hey let's not fight let's hug it out instead soft nucleophiles have lower electronegativity soft nucleophiles're bigger more polarizable and sometimes neutrally charged think that sulfur compounds iodide ions and resonance stabilized enolates hard and soft nucleophiles do have hard and soft electrophile counterparts and we'll just touch on this topic briefly with our enone example all we need to know for now is that soft nucleophiles are more likely to react with soft electrophiles and hard nucleophiles are more likely to react with hard electrophiles i guess colors like to cuddle and fighters like to fight so when we have an enone with two electrophilic sites the carbonyl carbon is a harder electrophile because the carbonyl carbon's closer to the electron pulling oxygen while the carbon at the four position is much softer and based on that cuddling versus fighting pattern a hard nucleophile is more likely to give us the one two addition product while a soft nucleophile is more likely to give us the conjugate addition product in fact remember our termites from the intro the toxic chemical weapon of the soldier termites is an enone and because so many biological groups have thials which are soft nucleophiles the toxin causes biological upset thanks to conjugate addition reactions the inactivated toxin which forms after exposure to the worker termites enzyme doesn't have a double bond conjugated with the carbonyl group the toxic chemical weapon of the soldier termites's unreactive with soft nucleophiles like thials and our worker termites live to build another day not only that but conjugate addition of thials are part of our penicillin v synthesis too this step of our mold medicine map starts off with the ring compound we made in the last episode first we mix methoxide with hydrogen sulfide gas and the methoxide nabs a proton the newly formed bisulfide anion a soft nucleophile attacks the enone of the beta position to form the conjugate addition product after attacks we have a cleavage step methoxide which is a harder nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon when the electrons move down from the oxygen the ring cleaves to leave an ester group at one end of the molecule at the other end we have our leaving group and the protonation at nitrogen leaves us with an amide so overall dr chien used a conjugate addition reaction to add the sulfur atom needed for the penicillin ring in episode 31 we saw that the next step was hydrolysis of both the ester and the amide comparing that to the five-membered ring of penicillin we can see that the next step introduced all but one of these atoms but the next step was a real brain bender so we'll end this episode here this time we learned that a cross aldo reaction involves joining an enolizable ketone and an aldehyde kinetic and thermodynamic enolates form under different conditions soft nucleophiles are more likely to attack soft electrophiles and hard nucleophiles are more likely to attack hard electrophiles for now we're done with enols and enolates but not with penicillin next time we'll cover amines and learn how dr shien closed up that five-membered ring until next time thanks for watching this episode if you want to help keep all crash course free for everybody forever you can join our community on patreon"]]

ERROR:root:payload: 'You can review content from Crash Course Organic Chemistry with the Crash Course App, available now for Android and iOS devices. Hi! I’m Deboki Chakravarti and welcome to Crash Course Organic Chemistry! To communicate with each other, insects often use organic chemistry! Instead of using words, they secrete compounds that can mean "hey, you\'re cute" or "follow this path for food!" or even "back off, you\'re gonna get hurt if you come any closer." Soldier termites, for example, defend their nests by secreting a toxic chemical. That wards off invaders just fine but, when they use these chemical weapons, they have to make sure they don’t also hurt their own nest-mates. Turns out, the worker termites in the nest have an enzyme that allows them to reduce the chemical from its toxic form to another, harmless, form. And in this reaction, only the double bond that is conjugated with the carbonyl is reduced. Specifically, the soldier termite’s toxin has a functional group called an enone. And the worker termite\'s enzyme selectively removes the alkene from that functional group. Enones can undergo a reaction called conjugate addition that simple alkenes can\'t. And this reaction makes the enone toxic to invaders. Let’s see why, and explore some more reactions and properties of enolates! [Theme Music] In the previous episode, we learned about aldol reactions, where two simple carbonyl compounds combine into a larger one. Specifically, we explored what happened when the two reactant molecules were the same. But if we join two different carbonyl compounds – like an enol or enolate and a different aldehyde or ketone – it\'s called a crossed aldol reaction. With crossed aldol reactions, it’s very important to choose the carbonyls carefully, otherwise we end up with a horrible mess of different products. Generally, it’s a good idea to use an enolizable ketone – with alpha-hydrogens – and a non-enolizable aldehyde. This works well because, first, only the ketone can form an enol (or enolate) and become the nucleophile in the reaction. And second, aldehydes are more reactive than ketones, because they\'re usually less hindered at the carbonyl carbon and less stabilized by inductive effects. So we minimize the chances of the ketone reacting with itself. It also helps to have the aldehyde in excess, because that way there’s much less chance of a ketone molecule bumping into another ketone molecule at all. The mechanism for a crossed aldol reaction looks like what we\'ve been doing in the last two episodes! We start with deprotonation of the enolizable ketone. Assuming we’re working under basic conditions, the next step is for the enolate anion to do its nucleophile thing and attack the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. Then, we pull a hydrogen off some nearby water to form the hydroxyl, and we have the aldol product. Remember these protons in between the alcohol and the carbonyl are pretty acidic, and we still have basic conditions. So, off goes a proton, and now we have the enolate of the aldol product. Finally, the hydroxide is eliminated through an E-1-c-B elimination, and we’re left with an unsaturated carbonyl compound. Honestly, there’s nothing really new here, except we used two different reactants. So let\'s throw something else into the mix: making an enolate from methyl isopropyl ketone. It has more than one alpha hydrogen, and when we mix it with base, we could form two different enolates. So… which one forms? Or is it both? To figure it out, let\'s take a moment to review Zaitsev’s rule: in elimination reactions that form alkenes, we tend to form the alkene product that we get by removing a hydrogen from the carbon with the fewest hydrogens. Or, to put it another way, we mostly get the more substituted alkene product. We can use similar logic here to figure out the enolate product. If we remove a proton from the more substituted alpha-carbon in the methyl isopropyl ketone, we get an enolate with a more substituted carbon-carbon double bond. This is a lower-energy product, and therefore more thermodynamically stable, so we call it the thermodynamic product. If we remove a proton from the less substituted alpha-carbon in the methyl isopropyl ketone, we get an enolate with a less substituted carbon-carbon double bond. This product forms more quickly, because the hydrogen being removed is more sterically accessible (there\'s less stuff around it). So we call it the kinetic product. So we have one enolate that’s lower in energy, but formed more slowly, and one that’s higher in energy, but formed more quickly. Which one we get depends on the reaction conditions. At low temperatures, we don’t have enough energy to get over the larger energy barrier. But we can get over the smaller energy barrier for the quick-forming, less-stable, higher-energy enolate – the kinetic product. At higher temperatures, there’s enough energy to get over both energy barriers and to reverse the reaction. So, over time, the slow-forming, more-stable, lower-energy enolate forms – the thermodynamic product. We also need to take into account what base we\'re using to form the enolate. Say we have a bigger, stronger, sterically-hindered base, such as lithium diisopropylamide, or LDA, and the deprotonation step is rapid and irreversible. In this case, the kinetic product will be favored. However, with weaker bases, like alkoxides, the pKa of the base and the enolate are close. This means that the enolate can interconvert between the two forms, so over time the more stable product “wins” and we end up with more of the thermodynamic product. So to recap: a strong base and a low temperature gives us the kinetic enolate. A weaker base and higher temperature gives us the thermodynamic enolate. Okay, now that we know how to puzzle through tricky enolate formation, let\'s try a crossed aldol condensation with enolizable hydrogens on both carbonyl substrates. I know earlier I said this could be a horrible mess of different products, but there are some tricks we can use to keep things simple. Let\'s take it step by step. We mentioned LDA a moment ago, and said it forms the enolate completely. We’re starting with methyl isopropyl ketone again, and here’s that LDA, nabbing one of the alpha protons to form the kinetic product. Then we add in an aldehyde, and the enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon. We’re still under basic conditions, which are non-aqueous so we can use a strong base like LDA. To finish up the reaction, we toss some acid into the mix at the end to protonate the oxygen and cause elimination. Now, there’s another way to look at these aldol reactions: backwards. Like we learned in Episode 34, using retrosynthesis to figure out how to make something is a lot of what we do in organic chemistry. Retrosynthesis is a bit like cutting up a beautiful cake to figure out the decorations, filling, and ingredients so you can make the same cake yourself from scratch. Just… don’t try to taste your reactions… So, for example, here\'s a cool compound: we notice this structure contains an enone, where an alkene is conjugated with a carbonyl, like a ketone (or aldehyde). This is a dehydrated product that can come from an aldol condensation. We can use retrosynthesis to reverse-engineer it. Let’s imagine cutting that carbon-carbon double bond with magic chemical scissors. The part containing the carbonyl is the enolate we need to form, and we just tack an oxygen onto the other part to figure out the carbonyl compound we need to attack. Ta da! We know which starting materials we need! Besides being fun to make, enones can also be reagents in some interesting chemical reactions. Let’s take a quick look at their structure: they’re often numbered based on the atoms in their conjugated system, starting with the high-priority oxygen atom. Looking at some resonance structures, we can see that the 4 position is electrophilic, which means it can be attacked by nucleophiles! Of course, the carbonyl carbon is also electrophilic – as they\'ve been throughout this whole series… and the known universe! So there are two possibilities for an enone reaction. There’s 1,2-nucleophilic addition, where the nucleophile adds to the carbonyl carbon. Alternatively, we could get 1,4-nucleophilic addition, also known as conjugate addition, where it adds at the 4 position. It’s using the whole conjugated system to do the reaction, and that’s where it gets its name. In 1,2-addition, the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon. The pi electrons in that bond are shunted up to the oxygen, which then picks up a proton to form a hydroxyl group. Fairly simple and familiar! In the conjugate addition mechanism, the nucleophile attacks the 4 position, and the enolate that forms is stabilized by resonance. Because of this, one of two things can happen next – but the product is the same either way! In one possible mechanism, the oxygen is protonated, and tautomerization gives the ketone. In the other, the alpha carbon picks up a proton to form the ketone directly. We have two possibilities again. This time, the nucleophilic attack is kinetically favored at the carbonyl carbon, meaning it\'s faster. On the other hand, the nucleophilic attack is thermodynamically favored at the alkene, meaning it\'s more stable. It turns out that conjugate addition reactions aren\'t unique to enones – conjugated carboxylic acid derivatives can undergo this kind of reaction, under the right conditions. The substrate\'s structure plays a big role in what reaction happens. For example, a nucleophile attacking an acid chloride is more likely to attack the carbonyl carbon. The strongly electron-withdrawing chlorine really polarizes the carbonyl carbon, making it super-attractive to nucleophiles and favoring 1,2-addition. But a nucleophile attacking an amide is headed for the 4 position. The nitrogen has lone pairs that stabilize the molecule by resonance, which makes the carbonyl less reactive and favors conjugate addition. The nucleophile is even more important, though! At this point, it’s helpful to think of them in two categories: hard nucleophiles and soft nucleophiles. Hardness and softness is related to charge and polarizability, which we learned about in Episode 11. Think of hard nucleophiles as kind of like… sharp weapons. They’re aggressive. They’re very electronegative, relatively small, and not very polarizable – think fluorides, alkoxides, organolithiums, and Grignard reagents. Soft nucleophiles, on the other hand, are cuddly. They say, "Hey, let’s not fight. Let’s hug it out instead!" They have lower electronegativity, they’re bigger, more polarizable, and sometimes neutrally charged – think sulfur compounds, iodide ions, and resonance stabilized enolates. Hard and soft nucleophiles do have hard and soft electrophile counterparts… and we’ll just touch on this topic briefly with our enone example. All we need to know for now is that soft nucleophiles are more likely to react with soft electrophiles, and hard nucleophiles are more likely to react with hard electrophiles. I guess cuddlers like to cuddle and fighters like to fight! So when we have an enone with two electrophilic sites, the carbonyl carbon is a harder electrophile because it’s closer to the electron-pulling oxygen, while the carbon at the 4 position is much softer. And based on that cuddling-versus-fighting pattern, a hard nucleophile is more likely to give us the 1,2-addition product, while a soft nucleophile is more likely to give us the conjugate addition product. In fact, remember our termites from the intro? The toxic chemical weapon of the soldier termites is an enone. And because so many biological groups have thiols, which are soft nucleophiles, the toxin causes biological upset thanks to conjugate addition reactions. The inactivated toxin, which forms after exposure to the worker termites’ enzyme, doesn’t have a double bond conjugated with the carbonyl group. It’s unreactive with soft nucleophiles like thiols, and our worker termites live to build another day! Not only that, but conjugate addition of thiols are part of our penicillin V synthesis, too! This step of our Mold Medicine Map starts off with the ring compound we made in the last episode. First, we mix methoxide with hydrogen sulfide gas, and the methoxide nabs a proton. The newly-formed bisulfide anion – a soft nucleophile – attacks the enone at the beta position to form the conjugate addition product. After that we have a cleavage step. Methoxide – which is a harder nucleophile – attacks the carbonyl carbon. When the electrons move down from the oxygen, the ring cleaves to leave an ester group at one end of the molecule. At the other end, we have our leaving group, and the protonation at nitrogen leaves us with an amide. So, overall, Dr. Sheehan used a conjugate addition reaction to add the sulfur atom needed for the penicillin ring! In Episode 31, we saw that the next step was hydrolysis of both the ester and the amide. Comparing that to the 5-membered ring of penicillin, we can see that this early step in the synthesis introduced all but one of these atoms. But that was a real brain bender, so we’ll end this episode here! This time we learned that: A crossed aldol reaction involves joining an enolizable ketone and an aldehyde, Kinetic and thermodynamic enolates form under different conditions, Soft nucleophiles are more likely to attack soft electrophiles, and Hard nucleophiles are more likely to attack hard electrophiles For now, we\'re done with enols and enolates – but not with penicillin! Next time we’ll cover amines, and learn how Dr. Sheehan closed up that 5-membered ring. Until next time, thanks for watching this episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry.

[Theme Music] In the previous episode, we learned about aldol reactions, where two simple carbonyl compounds combine into a larger one. Specifically, we explored what happened when the two reactant molecules were the same. But if we join two different carbonyl compounds – like an enol or enolate and a different aldehyde or ketone – it\'s called a crossed aldol reaction. With crossed aldol reactions, it’s very important to choose the carbonyls carefully, otherwise we end up with a horrible mess of different products. Generally, it’s a good idea to use an enolizable ketone – with alpha-hydrogens – and a non-enolizable aldehyde. This works well because, first, only the ketone can form an enol (or enolate) and become the nucleophile in the reaction. And second, aldehydes are more reactive than ketones, because they\'re usually less hindered at the carbonyl carbon and less stabilized by inductive effects. So we minimize the chances of the ketone reacting with itself. It also helps to have the aldehyde in excess, because that way there’s much less chance of a ketone molecule bumping into another ketone molecule at all. The mechanism for a crossed aldol reaction looks like what we\'ve been doing in the last two episodes! We start with deprotonation of the enolizable ketone. Assuming we’re working under basic conditions, the next step is for the enolate anion to do its nucleophile thing and attack the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. Then, we pull a hydrogen off some nearby water to form the hydroxyl, and we have the aldol product. Remember these protons in between the alcohol and the carbonyl are pretty acidic, and we still have basic conditions. So, off goes a proton, and now we have the enolate of the aldol product. Finally, the hydroxide is eliminated through an E-1-c-B elimination, and we’re left with an unsaturated carbonyl compound. Honestly, there’s nothing really new here, except we used two different reactants. So let\'s throw something else into the mix: making an enolate from methyl isopropyl ketone. It has more than one alpha hydrogen, and when we mix it with base, we could form two different enolates. So… which one forms? Or is it both? To figure it out, let\'s take a moment to review Zaitsev’s rule: in elimination reactions that form alkenes, we tend to form the alkene product that we get by removing a hydrogen from the carbon with the fewest hydrogens. Or, to put it another way, we mostly get the more substituted alkene product. We can use similar logic here to figure out the enolate product. If we remove a proton from the more substituted alpha-carbon in the methyl isopropyl ketone, we get an enolate with a more substituted carbon-carbon double bond. This is a lower-energy product, and therefore more thermodynamically stable, so we call it the thermodynamic product. If we remove a proton from the less substituted alpha-carbon in the methyl isopropyl ketone, we get an enolate with a less substituted carbon-carbon double bond. This product forms more quickly, because the hydrogen being removed is more sterically accessible (there\'s less stuff around it). So we call it the kinetic product. So we have one enolate that’s lower in energy, but formed more slowly, and one that’s higher in energy, but formed more quickly. Which one we get depends on the reaction conditions. At low temperatures, we don’t have enough energy to get over the larger energy barrier. But we can get over the smaller energy barrier for the quick-forming, less-stable, higher-energy enolate – the kinetic product. At higher temperatures, there’s enough energy to get over both energy barriers and to reverse the reaction. So, over time, the slow-forming, more-stable, lower-energy enolate forms – the thermodynamic product. We also need to take into account what base we\'re using to form the enolate. Say we have a bigger, stronger, sterically-hindered base, such as lithium diisopropylamide, or LDA, and the deprotonation step is rapid and irreversible. In this case, the kinetic product will be favored. However, with weaker bases, like alkoxides, the pKa of the base and the enolate are close. This means that the enolate can interconvert between the two forms, so over time the more stable product “wins” and we end up with more of the thermodynamic product. So to recap: a strong base and a low temperature gives us the kinetic enolate. A weaker base and higher temperature gives us the thermodynamic enolate. Okay, now that we know how to puzzle through tricky enolate formation, let\'s try a crossed aldol condensation with enolizable hydrogens on both carbonyl substrates. I know earlier I said this could be a horrible mess of different products, but there are some tricks we can use to keep things simple. Let\'s take it step by step. We mentioned LDA a moment ago, and said it forms the enolate completely. We’re starting with methyl isopropyl ketone again, and here’s that LDA, nabbing one of the alpha protons to form the kinetic product. Then we add in an aldehyde, and the enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon. We’re still under basic conditions, which are non-aqueous so we can use a strong base like LDA. To finish up the reaction, we toss some acid into the mix at the end to protonate the oxygen and cause elimination. Now, there’s another way to look at these aldol reactions: backwards. Like we learned in Episode 34, using retrosynthesis to figure out how to make something is a lot of what we do in organic chemistry. Retrosynthesis is a bit like cutting up a beautiful cake to figure out the decorations, filling, and ingredients so you can make the same cake yourself from scratch. Just… don’t try to taste your reactions… So, for example, here\'s a cool compound: we notice this structure contains an enone, where an alkene is conjugated with a carbonyl, like a ketone (or aldehyde). This is a dehydrated product that can come from an aldol condensation. We can use retrosynthesis to reverse-engineer it. Let’s imagine cutting that carbon-carbon double bond with magic chemical scissors. The part containing the carbonyl is the enolate we need to form, and we just tack an oxygen onto the other part to figure out the carbonyl compound we need to attack. Ta da! We know which starting materials we need! Besides being fun to make, enones can also be reagents in some interesting chemical reactions. Let’s take a quick look at their structure: they’re often numbered based on the atoms in their conjugated system, starting with the high-priority oxygen atom. Looking at some resonance structures, we can see that the 4 position is electrophilic, which means it can be attacked by nucleophiles! Of course, the carbonyl carbon is also electrophilic – as they\'ve been throughout this whole series… and the known universe! So there are two possibilities for an enone reaction. There’s 1,2-nucleophilic addition, where the nucleophile adds to the carbonyl carbon. Alternatively, we could get 1,4-nucleophilic addition, also known as conjugate addition, where it adds at the 4 position. It’s using the whole conjugated system to do the reaction, and that’s where it gets its name. In 1,2-addition, the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon. The pi electrons in that bond are shunted up to the oxygen, which then picks up a proton to form a hydroxyl group. Fairly simple and familiar! In the conjugate addition mechanism, the nucleophile attacks the 4 position, and the enolate that forms is stabilized by resonance. Because of this, one of two things can happen next – but the product is the same either way! In one possible mechanism, the oxygen is protonated, and tautomerization gives the ketone. In the other, the alpha carbon picks up a proton to form the ketone directly. We have two possibilities again. This time, the nucleophilic attack is kinetically favored at the carbonyl carbon, meaning it\'s faster. On the other hand, the nucleophilic attack is thermodynamically favored at the alkene, meaning it\'s more stable. It turns out that conjugate addition reactions aren\'t unique to enones – conjugated carboxylic acid derivatives can undergo this kind of reaction, under the right conditions. The substrate\'s structure plays a big role in what reaction happens. For example, a nucleophile attacking an acid chloride is more likely to attack the carbonyl carbon. The strongly electron-withdrawing chlorine really polarizes the carbonyl carbon, making it super-attractive to nucleophiles and favoring 1,2-addition. But a nucleophile attacking an amide is headed for the 4 position. The nitrogen has lone pairs that stabilize the molecule by resonance, which makes the carbonyl less reactive and favors conjugate addition. The nucleophile is even more important, though! At this point, it’s helpful to think of them in two categories: hard nucleophiles and soft nucleophiles. Hardness and softness is related to charge and polarizability, which we learned about in Episode 11. Think of hard nucleophiles as kind of like… sharp weapons. They’re aggressive. They’re very electronegative, relatively small, and not very polarizable – think fluorides, alkoxides, organolithiums, and Grignard reagents. Soft nucleophiles, on the other hand, are cuddly. They say, "Hey, let’s not fight. Let’s hug it out instead!" They have lower electronegativity, they’re bigger, more polarizable, and sometimes neutrally charged – think sulfur compounds, iodide ions, and resonance stabilized enolates. Hard and soft nucleophiles do have hard and soft electrophile counterparts… and we’ll just touch on this topic briefly with our enone example. All we need to know for now is that soft nucleophiles are more likely to react with soft electrophiles, and hard nucleophiles are more likely to react with hard electrophiles. I guess cuddlers like to cuddle and fighters like to fight! So when we have an enone with two electrophilic sites, the carbonyl carbon is a harder electrophile because it’s closer to the electron-pulling oxygen, while the carbon at the 4 position is much softer. And based on that cuddling-versus-fighting pattern, a hard nucleophile is more likely to give us the 1,2-addition product, while a soft nucleophile is more likely to give us the conjugate addition product. In fact, remember our termites from the intro? The toxic chemical weapon of the soldier termites is an enone. And because so many biological groups have thiols, which are soft nucleophiles, the toxin causes biological upset thanks to conjugate addition reactions. The inactivated toxin, which forms after exposure to the worker termites’ enzyme, doesn’t have a double bond conjugated with the carbonyl group. It’s unreactive with soft nucleophiles like thiols, and our worker termites live to build another day! Not only that, but conjugate addition of thiols are part of our penicillin V synthesis, too! This step of our Mold Medicine Map starts off with the ring compound we made in the last episode. First, we mix methoxide with hydrogen sulfide gas, and the methoxide nabs a proton. The newly-formed bisulfide anion – a soft nucleophile – attacks the enone at the beta position to form the conjugate addition product. After that we have a cleavage step. Methoxide – which is a harder nucleophile – attacks the carbonyl carbon. When the electrons move down from the oxygen, the ring cleaves to leave an ester group at one end of the molecule. At the other end, we have our leaving group, and the protonation at nitrogen leaves us with an amide. So, overall, Dr. Sheehan used a conjugate addition reaction to add the sulfur atom needed for the penicillin ring! In Episode 31, we saw that the next step was hydrolysis of both the ester and the amide. Comparing that to the 5-membered ring of penicillin, we can see that this early step in the synthesis introduced all but one of these atoms. But that was a real brain bender, so we’ll end this episode here! This time we learned that: A crossed aldol reaction involves joining an enolizable ketone and an aldehyde, Kinetic and thermodynamic enolates form under different conditions, Soft nucleophiles are more likely to attack soft electrophiles, and Hard nucleophiles are more likely to attack hard electrophiles For now, we\'re done with enols and enolates – but not with penicillin! Next time we’ll cover amines, and learn how Dr. Sheehan closed up that 5-membered ring. Until next time, thanks for watching this episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry.

ERROR:root:payload: 'You can review content from Crash Course Organic Chemistry with the Crash Course App, available now for Android and iOS devices. Hi! I’m Deboki Chakravarti and welcome to Crash Course Organic Chemistry! To communicate with each other, insects often use organic chemistry! Instead of using words, they secrete compounds that can mean "hey, you\'re cute" or "follow this path for food!" or even "back off, you\'re gonna get hurt if you come any closer." Soldier termites, for example, defend their nests by secreting a toxic chemical. That wards off invaders just fine but, when they use these chemical weapons, they have to make sure they don’t also hurt their own nest-mates. Turns out, the worker termites in the nest have an enzyme that allows them to reduce the chemical from its toxic form to another, harmless, form. And in this reaction, only the double bond that is conjugated with the carbonyl is reduced. Specifically, the soldier termite’s toxin has a functional group called an enone. And the worker termite\'s enzyme selectively removes the alkene from that functional group. Enones can undergo a reaction called conjugate addition that simple alkenes can\'t. And this reaction makes the enone toxic to invaders. Let’s see why, and explore some more reactions and properties of enolates! [Theme Music] In the previous episode, we learned about aldol reactions, where two simple carbonyl compounds combine into a larger one. Specifically, we explored what happened when the two reactant molecules were the same. But if we join two different carbonyl compounds – like an enol or enolate and a different aldehyde or ketone – it\'s called a crossed aldol reaction. With crossed aldol reactions, it’s very important to choose the carbonyls carefully, otherwise we end up with a horrible mess of different products. Generally, it’s a good idea to use an enolizable ketone – with alpha-hydrogens – and a non-enolizable aldehyde. This works well because, first, only the ketone can form an enol (or enolate) and become the nucleophile in the reaction. And second, aldehydes are more reactive than ketones, because they\'re usually less hindered at the carbonyl carbon and less stabilized by inductive effects. So we minimize the chances of the ketone reacting with itself. It also helps to have the aldehyde in excess, because that way there’s much less chance of a ketone molecule bumping into another ketone molecule at all. The mechanism for a crossed aldol reaction looks like what we\'ve been doing in the last two episodes! We start with deprotonation of the enolizable ketone. Assuming we’re working under basic conditions, the next step is for the enolate anion to do its nucleophile thing and attack the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. Then, we pull a hydrogen off some nearby water to form the hydroxyl, and we have the aldol product. Remember these protons in between the alcohol and the carbonyl are pretty acidic, and we still have basic conditions. So, off goes a proton, and now we have the enolate of the aldol product. Finally, the hydroxide is eliminated through an E-1-c-B elimination, and we’re left with an unsaturated carbonyl compound. Honestly, there’s nothing really new here, except we used two different reactants. So let\'s throw something else into the mix: making an enolate from methyl isopropyl ketone. It has more than one alpha hydrogen, and when we mix it with base, we could form two different enolates. So… which one forms? Or is it both? To figure it out, let\'s take a moment to review Zaitsev’s rule: in elimination reactions that form alkenes, we tend to form the alkene product that we get by removing a hydrogen from the carbon with the fewest hydrogens. Or, to put it another way, we mostly get the more substituted alkene product. We can use similar logic here to figure out the enolate product. If we remove a proton from the more substituted alpha-carbon in the methyl isopropyl ketone, we get an enolate with a more substituted carbon-carbon double bond. This is a lower-energy product, and therefore more thermodynamically stable, so we call it the thermodynamic product. If we remove a proton from the less substituted alpha-carbon in the methyl isopropyl ketone, we get an enolate with a less substituted carbon-carbon double bond. This product forms more quickly, because the hydrogen being removed is more sterically accessible (there\'s less stuff around it). So we call it the kinetic product. So we have one enolate that’s lower in energy, but formed more slowly, and one that’s higher in energy, but formed more quickly. Which one we get depends on the reaction conditions. At low temperatures, we don’t have enough energy to get over the larger energy barrier. But we can get over the smaller energy barrier for the quick-forming, less-stable, higher-energy enolate – the kinetic product. At higher temperatures, there’s enough energy to get over both energy barriers and to reverse the reaction. So, over time, the slow-forming, more-stable, lower-energy enolate forms – the thermodynamic product. We also need to take into account what base we\'re using to form the enolate. Say we have a bigger, stronger, sterically-hindered base, such as lithium diisopropylamide, or LDA, and the deprotonation step is rapid and irreversible. In this case, the kinetic product will be favored. However, with weaker bases, like alkoxides, the pKa of the base and the enolate are close. This means that the enolate can interconvert between the two forms, so over time the more stable product “wins” and we end up with more of the thermodynamic product. So to recap: a strong base and a low temperature gives us the kinetic enolate. A weaker base and higher temperature gives us the thermodynamic enolate. Okay, now that we know how to puzzle through tricky enolate formation, let\'s try a crossed aldol condensation with enolizable hydrogens on both carbonyl substrates. I know earlier I said this could be a horrible mess of different products, but there are some tricks we can use to keep things simple. Let\'s take it step by step. We mentioned LDA a moment ago, and said it forms the enolate completely. We’re starting with methyl isopropyl ketone again, and here’s that LDA, nabbing one of the alpha protons to form the kinetic product. Then we add in an aldehyde, and the enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon. We’re still under basic conditions, which are non-aqueous so we can use a strong base like LDA. To finish up the reaction, we toss some acid into the mix at the end to protonate the oxygen and cause elimination. Now, there’s another way to look at these aldol reactions: backwards. Like we learned in Episode 34, using retrosynthesis to figure out how to make something is a lot of what we do in organic chemistry. Retrosynthesis is a bit like cutting up a beautiful cake to figure out the decorations, filling, and ingredients so you can make the same cake yourself from scratch. Just… don’t try to taste your reactions… So, for example, here\'s a cool compound: we notice this structure contains an enone, where an alkene is conjugated with a carbonyl, like a ketone (or aldehyde). This is a dehydrated product that can come from an aldol condensation. We can use retrosynthesis to reverse-engineer it. Let’s imagine cutting that carbon-carbon double bond with magic chemical scissors. The part containing the carbonyl is the enolate we need to form, and we just tack an oxygen onto the other part to figure out the carbonyl compound we need to attack. Ta da! We know which starting materials we need! Besides being fun to make, enones can also be reagents in some interesting chemical reactions. Let’s take a quick look at their structure: they’re often numbered based on the atoms in their conjugated system, starting with the high-priority oxygen atom. Looking at some resonance structures, we can see that the 4 position is electrophilic, which means it can be attacked by nucleophiles! Of course, the carbonyl carbon is also electrophilic – as they\'ve been throughout this whole series… and the known universe! So there are two possibilities for an enone reaction. There’s 1,2-nucleophilic addition, where the nucleophile adds to the carbonyl carbon. Alternatively, we could get 1,4-nucleophilic addition, also known as conjugate addition, where it adds at the 4 position. It’s using the whole conjugated system to do the reaction, and that’s where it gets its name. In 1,2-addition, the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon. The pi electrons in that bond are shunted up to the oxygen, which then picks up a proton to form a hydroxyl group. Fairly simple and familiar! In the conjugate addition mechanism, the nucleophile attacks the 4 position, and the enolate that forms is stabilized by resonance. Because of this, one of two things can happen next – but the product is the same either way! In one possible mechanism, the oxygen is protonated, and tautomerization gives the ketone. In the other, the alpha carbon picks up a proton to form the ketone directly. We have two possibilities again. This time, the nucleophilic attack is kinetically favored at the carbonyl carbon, meaning it\'s faster. On the other hand, the nucleophilic attack is thermodynamically favored at the alkene, meaning it\'s more stable. It turns out that conjugate addition reactions aren\'t unique to enones – conjugated carboxylic acid derivatives can undergo this kind of reaction, under the right conditions. The substrate\'s structure plays a big role in what reaction happens. For example, a nucleophile attacking an acid chloride is more likely to attack the carbonyl carbon. The strongly electron-withdrawing chlorine really polarizes the carbonyl carbon, making it super-attractive to nucleophiles and favoring 1,2-addition. But a nucleophile attacking an amide is headed for the 4 position. The nitrogen has lone pairs that stabilize the molecule by resonance, which makes the carbonyl less reactive and favors conjugate addition. The nucleophile is even more important, though! At this point, it’s helpful to think of them in two categories: hard nucleophiles and soft nucleophiles. Hardness and softness is related to charge and polarizability, which we learned about in Episode 11. Think of hard nucleophiles as kind of like… sharp weapons. They’re aggressive. They’re very electronegative, relatively small, and not very polarizable – think fluorides, alkoxides, organolithiums, and Grignard reagents. Soft nucleophiles, on the other hand, are cuddly. They say, "Hey, let’s not fight. Let’s hug it out instead!" They have lower electronegativity, they’re bigger, more polarizable, and sometimes neutrally charged – think sulfur compounds, iodide ions, and resonance stabilized enolates. Hard and soft nucleophiles do have hard and soft electrophile counterparts… and we’ll just touch on this topic briefly with our enone example. All we need to know for now is that soft nucleophiles are more likely to react with soft electrophiles, and hard nucleophiles are more likely to react with hard electrophiles. I guess cuddlers like to cuddle and fighters like to fight! So when we have an enone with two electrophilic sites, the carbonyl carbon is a harder electrophile because it’s closer to the electron-pulling oxygen, while the carbon at the 4 position is much softer. And based on that cuddling-versus-fighting pattern, a hard nucleophile is more likely to give us the 1,2-addition product, while a soft nucleophile is more likely to give us the conjugate addition product. In fact, remember our termites from the intro? The toxic chemical weapon of the soldier termites is an enone. And because so many biological groups have thiols, which are soft nucleophiles, the toxin causes biological upset thanks to conjugate addition reactions. The inactivated toxin, which forms after exposure to the worker termites’ enzyme, doesn’t have a double bond conjugated with the carbonyl group. It’s unreactive with soft nucleophiles like thiols, and our worker termites live to build another day! Not only that, but conjugate addition of thiols are part of our penicillin V synthesis, too! This step of our Mold Medicine Map starts off with the ring compound we made in the last episode. First, we mix methoxide with hydrogen sulfide gas, and the methoxide nabs a proton. The newly-formed bisulfide anion – a soft nucleophile – attacks the enone at the beta position to form the conjugate addition product. After that we have a cleavage step. Methoxide – which is a harder nucleophile – attacks the carbonyl carbon. When the electrons move down from the oxygen, the ring cleaves to leave an ester group at one end of the molecule. At the other end, we have our leaving group, and the protonation at nitrogen leaves us with an amide. So, overall, Dr. Sheehan used a conjugate addition reaction to add the sulfur atom needed for the penicillin ring! In Episode 31, we saw that the next step was hydrolysis of both the ester and the amide. Comparing that to the 5-membered ring of penicillin, we can see that this early step in the synthesis introduced all but one of these atoms. But that was a real brain bender, so we’ll end this episode here! This time we learned that: A crossed aldol reaction involves joining an enolizable ketone and an aldehyde, Kinetic and thermodynamic enolates form under different conditions, Soft nucleophiles are more likely to attack soft electrophiles, and Hard nucleophiles are more likely to attack hard electrophiles For now, we\'re done with enols and enolates – but not with penicillin! Next time we’ll cover amines, and learn how Dr. Sheehan closed up that 5-membered ring. Until next time, thanks for watching this episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry.

Hard and soft nucleophiles do have hard and soft electrophile counterparts… and we’ll just touch on this topic briefly with our enone example. All we need to know for now is that soft nucleophiles are more likely to react with soft electrophiles, and hard nucleophiles are more likely to react with hard electrophiles. I guess cuddlers like to cuddle and fighters like to fight! So when we have an enone with two electrophilic sites, the carbonyl carbon is a harder electrophile because it’s closer to the electron-pulling oxygen, while the carbon at the 4 position is much softer. And based on that cuddling-versus-fighting pattern, a hard nucleophile is more likely to give us the 1,2-addition product, while a soft nucleophile is more likely to give us the conjugate addition product. In fact, remember our termites from the intro? The toxic chemical weapon of the soldier termites is an enone. And because so many biological groups have thiols, which are soft nucleophiles, the toxin causes biological upset thanks to conjugate addition reactions. The inactivated toxin, which forms after exposure to the worker termites’ enzyme, doesn’t have a double bond conjugated with the carbonyl group. It’s unreactive with soft nucleophiles like thiols, and our worker termites live to build another day! Not only that, but conjugate addition of thiols are part of our penicillin V synthesis, too! This step of our Mold Medicine Map starts off with the ring compound we made in the last episode. First, we mix methoxide with hydrogen sulfide gas, and the methoxide nabs a proton. The newly-formed bisulfide anion – a soft nucleophile – attacks the enone at the beta position to form the conjugate addition product. After that we have a cleavage step. Methoxide – which is a harder nucleophile – attacks the carbonyl carbon. When the electrons move down from the oxygen, the ring cleaves to leave an ester group at one end of the molecule. At the other end, we have our leaving group, and the protonation at nitrogen leaves us with an amide. So, overall, Dr. Sheehan used a conjugate addition reaction to add the sulfur atom needed for the penicillin ring! In Episode 31, we saw that the next step was hydrolysis of both the ester and the amide. Comparing that to the 5-membered ring of penicillin, we can see that this early step in the synthesis introduced all but one of these atoms. But that was a real brain bender, so we’ll end this episode here! This time we learned that: A crossed aldol reaction involves joining an enolizable ketone and an aldehyde, Kinetic and thermodynamic enolates form under different conditions, Soft nucleophiles are more likely to attack soft electrophiles, and Hard nucleophiles are more likely to attack hard electrophiles For now, we\'re done with enols and enolates – but not with penicillin! Next time we’ll cover amines, and learn how Dr. Sheehan closed up that 5-membered ring. Until next time, thanks for watching this episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry.

ERROR:root:payload: 'Hi I’m John Green and this is Crash Course European History. So far, we’ve seen a ton of political change and continuing warfare in the midst of the seventeenth century’s little ice age, and history often focuses on these types of political and military stories, but there were also other changes occurring: shifts in how people perceived the everyday world. The linking of phenomena like earthquakes and eclipses with human events goes back a very long way, like to the beginning of our species, as does the belief that supernatural forces are deeply shaping the lives of individual humans. For instance, in a previous video about witchcraft, we discussed how earthquake tremors in Istanbul in 1648 were seen as portents of a sultan’s death a few months later. But a century after that, a huge earthquake struck Lisbon, Portugal on All Saints’ Day of 1755. Tens of thousands of people died, many from a tsunami that followed the quake. Now, some theologians argued this was punishment from God for the world’s sins, but others pointed out that the earthquake had destroyed a lot of churches while sparing a lot of brothels. Voltaire wrote a famous poem in response to the earthquake that included the memorable lines “As the dying voices call out, will you dare respond to this appalling spectacle of smoking ashes with, “This is the necessary effect of the eternal laws Freely chosen by God?” The way Europeans were looking at the world had changed between the Istanbul earthquake and the Lisbon one: The Enlightenment was thriving. [Intro] So, today we want to emphasize that the Enlightenment wasn’t all high fallutin’ calculations of the sun’s orbit or theories about the mathematical laws of the universe or for that matter theories about earthquake causality. It also considered more down-to-earth situations like how people of different social classes relate to one another, how trade and manufacturing should function, and what the relationship of ordinary people should be to their government. The Enlightenment or Age of Light refers to the belief that the musty old ideas needed to be exposed to rational investigation to see if they were still valuable. The bright light of reason needed to shine on tradition. And this momentous challenge to tradition came about during a time in which Europe was being completely transformed in many ways that are sometimes forgotten amid all the excitement about Voltaire and reason. So let’s go straight to the Thought Bubble today. 1. Beyond the wars and state-building we’ve already seen, 2. increasing abundance and novelty was creeping into the everyday lives of Europeans. 3. Coffee, tea, chocolate, tobacco, and other commodities led to experimentation. 4. For instance, one English housewife saw tea for the first time and thought it was meant to be baked as a kind of pie filling. 5. A diplomat said that tea and coffee had brought a greater “sobriety” and “civility” to everyday life in Europe. 6. Europe had previously been a land of famine and mere subsistence for essentially all of its history. 7. But now the cultivation of new foods from the Americas like potatoes and corn, 8. along with literally thousands of other new plants, meant that available calories were increasing, 9. And it also introduced the idea that maybe the world didn’t have to be perpetually on the brink of starvation and catastrophe. 10. Also, by this time, tens of thousands of Europeans had traveled the world, and had experienced other social orders first hand. 11. For instance, travelers discovered that people across Asia didn’t seem as quarrelsome as Europeans. 12. Drivers of carts did not block narrow streets for hours arguing over who had the right of way. 13. They politely agreed to let one or the other pass. 14. They also saw that not all social orders were as hierarchical as most European ones, 15. and that some societies even gave less weight to a person’s parentage 16. and more to that person’s individual skills and talents. Thanks Thought Bubble. [[TV-Montesquieu]] One of the first ways writers criticized outmoded ways of life was to make fun of them...writers like Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, aka Just Montesquieu. (He really was the person to criticize outmoded ways of life because, boy did he have an outmoded name.) Montesquieu was a jurist who owned an estate near Bordeaux, which still makes wine under his name, and in 1721, he published the Persian Letters in which Uzbek visitors find Europe amusing if not shocking. The visitors, for instance, are amazed at the magic of priests who somehow perform the trick of turning wine into blood. And although they clearly see the problems in French society, they firmly adhere to the mustiness of their own ways, such as keeping women secluded in a harem and guarded by eunuchs. The message was that both easterners and Europeans were imperfect. The author Voltaire--who, slightly off topic, was very handsome. I mean, very striking eyes. At any rate, he had similarly critical and amusing takes; his discourtesy to aristocrats eventually got him sent to the Bastille prison, in fact. In many rollicking tales, he made fun of overweening rulers and their endless corruptions. He valued honesty and those who lived simple lives “cultivating their gardens,” as he famously put it in his satirical novel Candide (1759), which you can learn more about in Crash Course Literature. Full of horrors and injustice, Candide appeared four years after the Lisbon earthquake, which Voltaire thought was firm evidence that we did not live in the best of all possible worlds. To replace the old stuffy ways of monarchs and aristocrats, people needed to learn how to embrace the newly-desirable traits of the Enlightenment, like being honest, and inquisitive, and open. Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau had many ideas about education reform, for instance. He was not a wealthy or titled person but rather was born into a watchmaking family and lived among artisans. His best-selling novel Emile (1762) describes a boy who grows up not in a city or palace but in a countryside where one can be oneself—a natural individual. Instead of experiencing common rote learning, with large doses of religious and classical reading, Emile learns carpentry, and gardening, and other practical skills. In the countryside he behaves in the best possible way—naturally and without pretentious airs. Rousseau promoted what would come to be called middle-class values, like hard work, practicality, and domesticity for women. When Emile becomes a young man, the spouse chosen for him is plump and smiling and devoted to taking care of him—not studying or reading or practicing a craft or working hard to support the family like farm women did. Also, she will breast feed their children, whereas both aristocratic women and busy working women at the time commonly used wet nurses. As with Emile’s upbringing, all of this is presented as “natural.” Meanwhile, wealthy women in Europe instituted the Enlightenment salon: regular get-togethers in their homes to hear the latest idea, learn about the latest book, or meet the latest philosopher-influencer—called a philosophe in French. Slightly off topic, but I just love the idea of Rousseau and Voltaire as influencers. Like, I would have loved to see their instagram feeds. Voltaire’s smoldering selfies, Rousseau’s weird rants written in the notes app and then screenshotted. It would have been gold. At any rate, 18th Century Salon goers were often great readers or experimenters with the latest commodities and fashion. Just like contemporary influencers, actually. And in terms of fashion, instead of looking to the courts for fashion inspiration, men like Voltaire now sported cottons from India made into handkerchiefs that were worn around the neck, which would soon metamorphose into the necktie). They also sported banyans—that is loose bathrobe type garments—that did not need corsets, which men traditionally wore. As Rousseau believed, men should take off their make-up, wigs, and high heels and be natural—just like people did in other parts of the world. Just natural man as he is naturally made in the countryside, wearing a Banyan and a feathered hat. Transformation was in the air for everyone, not just the elites. Although imported foreign cottons were still illegal in France, for instance, many people now wore them, including servants, who received cast-off cotton dresses or shirts that were bright and easy to keep clean. And to help people learn, there were many more texts. Like in France, there was the Encyclopedie (you’ll notice my amazing French pronunciation). It provided discussions of topics such as natural rights and the status of women. Its main editor Denis Diderot wrote: “All things must be examined, debated, investigated without exception and without regard for anyone’s feelings.”[1] Diderot favored social and political reform. But the Encyclopedie--you know what, I’m gonna just translate it--Encyclopedia, also contained technical drawings of machinery, including machinery for mining. And that reflected practical values and also provided a spur to inventiveness and growing prosperity in Europe. Also, mining, which was already pretty important, was about to become EXTREMELY important, thanks to coal. In general, Enlightenment aims were more worldly than spiritual. In Scotland, philosopher David Hume promoted reason above religion, concluding that belief in God was mere superstition. Some people, called Deists, argued that God existed but that he didn’t influence everyday life after having set the machine of the universe in motion. Many important “founding fathers” of the United States were deists, and if you believe, as many philosphers did, that God keeps a distance from human affairs, then the persecution of people for their religious beliefs starts to seem like cruel fanaticism. And some philosophes became activists. Like, Voltaire was outraged by the torture of Jean Calas, who had been accused of murdering his son to prevent him from converting to Catholicism. (Calas’s son had in fact committed suicide due to gambling debts.) Calas was waterboarded and had every bone in his body broken before eventually dying under torture. Is there a bone back there? All right, listen. This is a femur. I don’t think this is an actual femur, I think it’s, like a recrea--Stan is this a real femur? It is NOT a real femur. So I asked our brilliant writer Bonnie if Calas really had every bone in his body broken and she repsonded, “It’s hard to know whether they got every one,” and then she described Calas’s torture to me with a level of detail that led me to conclude that ONE they probably did break every bone in his body, and TWO oh my god torture in 18th century Europe was THE WORST. So, last thing I’m going to say about this: if you invent a time machine, and I believe absolutely that you can, do not go back in time before like, maybe 2003? Don’t get me wrong--things are bad, but remember: they used to be so much worse. Speaking of terrible, let’s talk about slavery. So, Enlightenment views also fed into rising movements in Britain, France, the Netherlands, and their colonies to abolish slavery. By this time, the slave trade was massive and there was growing acknowledgement of its cruelt. In 1770, the French Catholic abbé (or, clergyman) Guillaume Raynal laid out the violent devastation of native peoples by invading Europeans. And in 1788 the freed slave Olaudah Equiano described the middle passage after he had been kidnapped in present-day Nigeria and enslaved. Now Equiano is often believed to have been born in South Carolina, and his riveting memoir may have been cobbled together from the harrowing tales of others. Still, it was a bestseller. It captured the inhumanity of whites towards blacks, advocated Enlightenment freedom and human rights for all. It also stirred freedmen and slaves to struggle for abolition. And there was also growing movements for other kinds of freedom. The Scotsman Adam Smith took on the mercantilist theory that global wealth was static and states could only increase wealth by taking it from others when he rejected ideas about stockpiling gold, and refusing entry of goods into one’s country, and also remaining a subsistence agricultural economy with serfs. He advocated for manufacturing, the division of labor, and free trade. In a free or laissez-faire market, an individual would work and interact with others in the economy on the basis of their self-interest. And the sum of all self-interests would make for a balanced, harmonious, and prosperous society. Smith is best known as the father of the free market, free trade, and individualism thanks to his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations. But he also opposed absolutism and urged concern for the overall well-being of society. In addition to the benefits of laissez-faire that he saw, Smith saw the potential harms, so he also argued for healing social policies. Another important Enlightenment book was Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s The Social Contract, which famously begins “Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains.” Rousseau picked up on John Locke’s theme of the contract that individuals made with one another to form a state or nation. And he believed that Once freely formed, the state embodied the best that was in the collective community; thus individuals needed to give the state unconditional obedience because it represented the “general will.” Today, thinkers see that this call for obedience to the general will planted the seeds of dictatorial governments in the twentieth century and beyond. But, Rousseau did also emphasize individual sentiments as valuable. At the opposite end of Rousseau’s “general will” was German philosopher Emmanuel Kant’s attention to individual reason. He famously exclaimed, “Dare to Know” as he advanced the Enlightenment’s commitment to the human mind and the ability of every person to think for themselves instead of simply obeying old commands and ideas. The human mind, he argued, housed “categories of understanding” with which information interacted to produce purely rational judgments. And in this way, Kant shared the faith in the individual of both Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith, and we can trace our own culture’s individualism back to the Enlightenment. And many other individuals took refuge in Enlightenment thought as well as taking it as a call to action. Upper-class Jewish women across Europe found the world of ideas so inspiring that they began salons, too. In Berlin, they established nine of the fourteen salons in the city. And philosopher and author Moses Mendelssohn used the more tolerant atmosphere to express his optimism about the future of Jews in Europe. Because of the Enlightenment emphasis on reason, he believed that the age-old persecution of Jews would soon end. Of course, we now know that that wasn’t the case. And much exploitation and oppression has taken place in the guise of reasoned thought. Pseudoscientific “reason” has been used to justify many forms of structural inequality, from racism to sexism to class systems. Rationality would not prove to be a way out of the human urge to create and marginalize outsiders. But Enlightenment thought was nonetheless transformative, and seeking worldly explanations for inequality and injustice did have significant real-world consequences. I mean, no longer would we see Earthquakes merely as acts of God. Enlightenment challenges to the idea that we already were living in the best of all possible worlds would help us to imagine, and eventually live in, better worlds--albeit ones that are still profoundly imperfect. Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next time. ________________ [1] Quoted in Lynn Hunt et al., The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures, 6th ed. (Boston: Bedford St. Martins, 2019) 616.'

ERROR:root:payload: 'Good Morning John. I’m about to tell you a story that no one knows. A story that honestly I didn’t know until I looked it up in my gchat archives. It’s the story of how you told me about the most impactful idea that we have ever had. Allow me to read you the transcript of the chat that we had on September 26, 2010. John: Ok, here is my idea. I want to make a five minute video that covers the whole French revolution and it is hilarious and it is fun to watch and it has lots of visual aids. No one in education even treats it like it’s interesting but I mean, they made a deal in an indoor tennis court because the kind was a baby and locked the door to their *** meeting room. It’s like the single most interesting moment in world history except for when the prince of Nepal became a serial killer. So… Is that not a great idea? Me: It is a great idea. John: Ok, I will do it. And that really is how Crash Course was born. Except that I left something out. And I lied a little bit. John: And I want that video to be our entire pitch to [redacted] and other venture capitalists. Because we were pretty sure this was something we could do, and would have a lot of impact, but we couldn’t imagine having the funding necessary to do it without the support of traditional venture capital and I don’t doubt that if Crash Course had had to take that path that it could have been successful, I just think that if we’d done that a lot of it would be behind a paywall right now. But thanks to a lot of things going right, including John, you advocating for it over and over again in the face of me having terrible other ideas. Which this chat also includes some of. We have never had to take investment and honestly that has been extremely powerful for Crash Course because it has meant that we’ve always been focused on keeping it free. In that initial chat John, you were talking about something that we still talk about now. We call it lowering barriers to learning. Some of those barriers are just pretending, for some reason, like the French Revolution isn’t dramatically interesting. Like, making it boring is a completely unnecessary barrier. But one of many other barriers to learning would be great educational video that costs a lot of money for teachers and students. That is a barrier that we are trying to prove is unnecessary. I’d be lying though if I said that wasn’t really challenging. Like somedays I think, maybe that barrier is a necessary barrier. I don’t know everyday how we’re going to make Crash Course work. It has required a lot of weird thinking on both the “how do we make money if we’re not going to charge for this” front, and also a lot of thinking on the “how do we make this as inexpensively as possible” which I think is important. We need to essentialize, we need to figure out what is the most important thing for lowering those barriers and do not more than that. But in educational content there are corners that you cannot cut, and there are also corners that you kinda can but just don’t want to. We want to do more, we want to do it better, and we want to treat our teams and our contractors better. At Crash Course and Complexly in general we’ve had to be really creative over the years with how we make money. With advertising and taking grant money from any organization that really understands our mission, and with Subbable and then Patreon, and now with a new thing that is ending today: The Crash Course Coin. I’m very sorry if you didn’t hear about this sooner because this is the last day. But there are 2 coins, one is $100 and one is $500 and each represents a piece of our budget that will allow us to reach either 2,000 or 10,000 students. Each one of them is being minted at a small family owned mint in Arkansas from hand etched dyes, and this has been so successful that there will be a different 2022 coin available next year, but this is literally the last day that you can get the 2021 coin. The $500 ones are probably sold out by the time this video goes up, but maybe not. This was the very first one that was minted, it has 001 on it. It’s going to the first person who bought a $500 Crash Course Coin. And you know who that person was? John, it was our mom. I thought I was going to fake cry and then I started to real cry a little bit. If you are watching this and it is not Friday June 25th, I’m sorry the Crash Course Coins are no longer available, but you can still support us on Patreon. More than 10 years into this journey we are so excited to continue finding ways to lower barriers to learning. John, it was a great idea. I’ll see you on Tuesday.'

ERROR:root:payload: 'Hi I’m John Green and this is Crash Course European History. So far, we’ve seen a ton of political change and continuing warfare in the midst of the seventeenth century’s little ice age, and history often focuses on these types of political and military stories, but there were also other changes occurring: shifts in how people perceived the everyday world. The linking of phenomena like earthquakes and eclipses with human events goes back a very long way, like to the beginning of our species, as does the belief that supernatural forces are deeply shaping the lives of individual humans. For instance, in a previous video about witchcraft, we discussed how earthquake tremors in Istanbul in 1648 were seen as portents of a sultan’s death a few months later. But a century after that, a huge earthquake struck Lisbon, Portugal on All Saints’ Day of 1755. Tens of thousands of people died, many from a tsunami that followed the quake. Now, some theologians argued this was punishment from God for the world’s sins, but others pointed out that the earthquake had destroyed a lot of churches while sparing a lot of brothels. Voltaire wrote a famous poem in response to the earthquake that included the memorable lines “As the dying voices call out, will you dare respond to this appalling spectacle of smoking ashes with, “This is the necessary effect of the eternal laws Freely chosen by God?” The way Europeans were looking at the world had changed between the Istanbul earthquake and the Lisbon one: The Enlightenment was thriving. [Intro] So, today we want to emphasize that the Enlightenment wasn’t all high fallutin’ calculations of the sun’s orbit or theories about the mathematical laws of the universe or for that matter theories about earthquake causality. It also considered more down-to-earth situations like how people of different social classes relate to one another, how trade and manufacturing should function, and what the relationship of ordinary people should be to their government. The Enlightenment or Age of Light refers to the belief that the musty old ideas needed to be exposed to rational investigation to see if they were still valuable. The bright light of reason needed to shine on tradition. And this momentous challenge to tradition came about during a time in which Europe was being completely transformed in many ways that are sometimes forgotten amid all the excitement about Voltaire and reason. So let’s go straight to the Thought Bubble today. 1. Beyond the wars and state-building we’ve already seen, 2. increasing abundance and novelty was creeping into the everyday lives of Europeans. 3. Coffee, tea, chocolate, tobacco, and other commodities led to experimentation. 4. For instance, one English housewife saw tea for the first time and thought it was meant to be baked as a kind of pie filling. 5. A diplomat said that tea and coffee had brought a greater “sobriety” and “civility” to everyday life in Europe. 6. Europe had previously been a land of famine and mere subsistence for essentially all of its history. 7. But now the cultivation of new foods from the Americas like potatoes and corn, 8. along with literally thousands of other new plants, meant that available calories were increasing, 9. And it also introduced the idea that maybe the world didn’t have to be perpetually on the brink of starvation and catastrophe. 10. Also, by this time, tens of thousands of Europeans had traveled the world, and had experienced other social orders first hand. 11. For instance, travelers discovered that people across Asia didn’t seem as quarrelsome as Europeans. 12. Drivers of carts did not block narrow streets for hours arguing over who had the right of way. 13. They politely agreed to let one or the other pass. 14. They also saw that not all social orders were as hierarchical as most European ones, 15. and that some societies even gave less weight to a person’s parentage 16. and more to that person’s individual skills and talents. Thanks Thought Bubble. [[TV-Montesquieu]] One of the first ways writers criticized outmoded ways of life was to make fun of them...writers like Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, aka Just Montesquieu. (He really was the person to criticize outmoded ways of life because, boy did he have an outmoded name.) Montesquieu was a jurist who owned an estate near Bordeaux, which still makes wine under his name, and in 1721, he published the Persian Letters in which Uzbek visitors find Europe amusing if not shocking. The visitors, for instance, are amazed at the magic of priests who somehow perform the trick of turning wine into blood. And although they clearly see the problems in French society, they firmly adhere to the mustiness of their own ways, such as keeping women secluded in a harem and guarded by eunuchs. The message was that both easterners and Europeans were imperfect. The author Voltaire--who, slightly off topic, was very handsome. I mean, very striking eyes. At any rate, he had similarly critical and amusing takes; his discourtesy to aristocrats eventually got him sent to the Bastille prison, in fact. In many rollicking tales, he made fun of overweening rulers and their endless corruptions. He valued honesty and those who lived simple lives “cultivating their gardens,” as he famously put it in his satirical novel Candide (1759), which you can learn more about in Crash Course Literature. Full of horrors and injustice, Candide appeared four years after the Lisbon earthquake, which Voltaire thought was firm evidence that we did not live in the best of all possible worlds. To replace the old stuffy ways of monarchs and aristocrats, people needed to learn how to embrace the newly-desirable traits of the Enlightenment, like being honest, and inquisitive, and open. Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau had many ideas about education reform, for instance. He was not a wealthy or titled person but rather was born into a watchmaking family and lived among artisans. His best-selling novel Emile (1762) describes a boy who grows up not in a city or palace but in a countryside where one can be oneself—a natural individual. Instead of experiencing common rote learning, with large doses of religious and classical reading, Emile learns carpentry, and gardening, and other practical skills. In the countryside he behaves in the best possible way—naturally and without pretentious airs. Rousseau promoted what would come to be called middle-class values, like hard work, practicality, and domesticity for women. When Emile becomes a young man, the spouse chosen for him is plump and smiling and devoted to taking care of him—not studying or reading or practicing a craft or working hard to support the family like farm women did. Also, she will breast feed their children, whereas both aristocratic women and busy working women at the time commonly used wet nurses. As with Emile’s upbringing, all of this is presented as “natural.” Meanwhile, wealthy women in Europe instituted the Enlightenment salon: regular get-togethers in their homes to hear the latest idea, learn about the latest book, or meet the latest philosopher-influencer—called a philosophe in French. Slightly off topic, but I just love the idea of Rousseau and Voltaire as influencers. Like, I would have loved to see their instagram feeds. Voltaire’s smoldering selfies, Rousseau’s weird rants written in the notes app and then screenshotted. It would have been gold. At any rate, 18th Century Salon goers were often great readers or experimenters with the latest commodities and fashion. Just like contemporary influencers, actually. And in terms of fashion, instead of looking to the courts for fashion inspiration, men like Voltaire now sported cottons from India made into handkerchiefs that were worn around the neck, which would soon metamorphose into the necktie). They also sported banyans—that is loose bathrobe type garments—that did not need corsets, which men traditionally wore. As Rousseau believed, men should take off their make-up, wigs, and high heels and be natural—just like people did in other parts of the world. Just natural man as he is naturally made in the countryside, wearing a Banyan and a feathered hat. Transformation was in the air for everyone, not just the elites. Although imported foreign cottons were still illegal in France, for instance, many people now wore them, including servants, who received cast-off cotton dresses or shirts that were bright and easy to keep clean. And to help people learn, there were many more texts. Like in France, there was the Encyclopedie (you’ll notice my amazing French pronunciation). It provided discussions of topics such as natural rights and the status of women. Its main editor Denis Diderot wrote: “All things must be examined, debated, investigated without exception and without regard for anyone’s feelings.”[1] Diderot favored social and political reform. But the Encyclopedie--you know what, I’m gonna just translate it--Encyclopedia, also contained technical drawings of machinery, including machinery for mining. And that reflected practical values and also provided a spur to inventiveness and growing prosperity in Europe. Also, mining, which was already pretty important, was about to become EXTREMELY important, thanks to coal. In general, Enlightenment aims were more worldly than spiritual. In Scotland, philosopher David Hume promoted reason above religion, concluding that belief in God was mere superstition. Some people, called Deists, argued that God existed but that he didn’t influence everyday life after having set the machine of the universe in motion. Many important “founding fathers” of the United States were deists, and if you believe, as many philosphers did, that God keeps a distance from human affairs, then the persecution of people for their religious beliefs starts to seem like cruel fanaticism. And some philosophes became activists. Like, Voltaire was outraged by the torture of Jean Calas, who had been accused of murdering his son to prevent him from converting to Catholicism. (Calas’s son had in fact committed suicide due to gambling debts.) Calas was waterboarded and had every bone in his body broken before eventually dying under torture. Is there a bone back there? All right, listen. This is a femur. I don’t think this is an actual femur, I think it’s, like a recrea--Stan is this a real femur? It is NOT a real femur. So I asked our brilliant writer Bonnie if Calas really had every bone in his body broken and she repsonded, “It’s hard to know whether they got every one,” and then she described Calas’s torture to me with a level of detail that led me to conclude that ONE they probably did break every bone in his body, and TWO oh my god torture in 18th century Europe was THE WORST. So, last thing I’m going to say about this: if you invent a time machine, and I believe absolutely that you can, do not go back in time before like, maybe 2003? Don’t get me wrong--things are bad, but remember: they used to be so much worse. Speaking of terrible, let’s talk about slavery. So, Enlightenment views also fed into rising movements in Britain, France, the Netherlands, and their colonies to abolish slavery. By this time, the slave trade was massive and there was growing acknowledgement of its cruelt. In 1770, the French Catholic abbé (or, clergyman) Guillaume Raynal laid out the violent devastation of native peoples by invading Europeans. And in 1788 the freed slave Olaudah Equiano described the middle passage after he had been kidnapped in present-day Nigeria and enslaved. Now Equiano is often believed to have been born in South Carolina, and his riveting memoir may have been cobbled together from the harrowing tales of others. Still, it was a bestseller. It captured the inhumanity of whites towards blacks, advocated Enlightenment freedom and human rights for all. It also stirred freedmen and slaves to struggle for abolition. And there was also growing movements for other kinds of freedom. The Scotsman Adam Smith took on the mercantilist theory that global wealth was static and states could only increase wealth by taking it from others when he rejected ideas about stockpiling gold, and refusing entry of goods into one’s country, and also remaining a subsistence agricultural economy with serfs. He advocated for manufacturing, the division of labor, and free trade. In a free or laissez-faire market, an individual would work and interact with others in the economy on the basis of their self-interest. And the sum of all self-interests would make for a balanced, harmonious, and prosperous society. Smith is best known as the father of the free market, free trade, and individualism thanks to his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations. But he also opposed absolutism and urged concern for the overall well-being of society. In addition to the benefits of laissez-faire that he saw, Smith saw the potential harms, so he also argued for healing social policies. Another important Enlightenment book was Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s The Social Contract, which famously begins “Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains.” Rousseau picked up on John Locke’s theme of the contract that individuals made with one another to form a state or nation. And he believed that Once freely formed, the state embodied the best that was in the collective community; thus individuals needed to give the state unconditional obedience because it represented the “general will.” Today, thinkers see that this call for obedience to the general will planted the seeds of dictatorial governments in the twentieth century and beyond. But, Rousseau did also emphasize individual sentiments as valuable. At the opposite end of Rousseau’s “general will” was German philosopher Emmanuel Kant’s attention to individual reason. He famously exclaimed, “Dare to Know” as he advanced the Enlightenment’s commitment to the human mind and the ability of every person to think for themselves instead of simply obeying old commands and ideas. The human mind, he argued, housed “categories of understanding” with which information interacted to produce purely rational judgments. And in this way, Kant shared the faith in the individual of both Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith, and we can trace our own culture’s individualism back to the Enlightenment. And many other individuals took refuge in Enlightenment thought as well as taking it as a call to action. Upper-class Jewish women across Europe found the world of ideas so inspiring that they began salons, too. In Berlin, they established nine of the fourteen salons in the city. And philosopher and author Moses Mendelssohn used the more tolerant atmosphere to express his optimism about the future of Jews in Europe. Because of the Enlightenment emphasis on reason, he believed that the age-old persecution of Jews would soon end. Of course, we now know that that wasn’t the case. And much exploitation and oppression has taken place in the guise of reasoned thought. Pseudoscientific “reason” has been used to justify many forms of structural inequality, from racism to sexism to class systems. Rationality would not prove to be a way out of the human urge to create and marginalize outsiders. But Enlightenment thought was nonetheless transformative, and seeking worldly explanations for inequality and injustice did have significant real-world consequences. I mean, no longer would we see Earthquakes merely as acts of God. Enlightenment challenges to the idea that we already were living in the best of all possible worlds would help us to imagine, and eventually live in, better worlds--albeit ones that are still profoundly imperfect. Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next time. ________________ [1] Quoted in Lynn Hunt et al., The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures, 6th ed. (Boston: Bedford St. Martins, 2019) 616.'
ERROR:root:orig input: ' Hi I’m John Green and this is Crash Course European History. So far, we’ve seen a ton of political change and continuing warfare in the midst of the seventeenth century’s little ice age, and history often focuses on these types of political and military stories, but there were also other changes occurring: shifts in how people perceived the everyday world. The linking of phenomena like earthquakes and eclipses with human events goes back a very long way, like to the beginning of our species, as does the belief that supernatural forces are deeply shaping the lives of individual humans. For instance, in a previous video about witchcraft, we discussed how earthquake tremors in Istanbul in 1648 were seen as portents of a sultan’s death a few months later. But a century after that, a huge earthquake struck Lisbon, Portugal on All Saints’ Day of 1755. Tens of thousands of people died, many from a tsunami that followed the quake. Now, some theologians argued this was punishment from God for the world’s sins, but others pointed out that the earthquake had destroyed a lot of churches while sparing a lot of brothels. Voltaire wrote a famous poem in response to the earthquake that included the memorable lines “As the dying voices call out, will you dare respond to this appalling spectacle of smoking ashes with, “This is the necessary effect of the eternal laws Freely chosen by God?” The way Europeans were looking at the world had changed between the Istanbul earthquake and the Lisbon one: The Enlightenment was thriving. [Intro] So, today we want to emphasize that the Enlightenment wasn’t all high fallutin’ calculations of the sun’s orbit or theories about the mathematical laws of the universe or for that matter theories about earthquake causality. It also considered more down-to-earth situations like how people of different social classes relate to one another, how trade and manufacturing should function, and what the relationship of ordinary people should be to their government. The Enlightenment or Age of Light refers to the belief that the musty old ideas needed to be exposed to rational investigation to see if they were still valuable. The bright light of reason needed to shine on tradition. And this momentous challenge to tradition came about during a time in which Europe was being completely transformed in many ways that are sometimes forgotten amid all the excitement about Voltaire and reason.

as hierarchical as most European ones, 15. and that some societies even gave less weight to a person’s parentage 16. and more to a person’s's individual skills and talents.","Thanks Thought Bubble.","[[TV-Montesquieu]] One of the first ways writers criticized outmoded ways of life was to make fun of outmoded ways of life...writers like Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, aka Just Montesquieu.","(Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, aka Just Montesquieu really was the person to criticize outmoded ways of life because, boy did Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, aka Just Montesquieu have an outmoded name.)","Montesquieu was a jurist who owned an estate near Bordeaux, which still makes wine under Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, aka Just Montesquieu's name, and in 1721, Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, aka Just Montesquieu published the Persian Letters in which Uzbek visitors find Europe amusing if not shocking.","The visitors, for instance, are amazed at the magic of priests who somehow perform the trick of turning wine into blood.","And although Uzbek visitors clearly see the problems in French society, Uzbek visitors firmly adhere to the mustiness of Uzbek visitors's own ways, such as keeping women secluded in a harem and guarded by eunuchs.","The message was that both easterners and Europeans were imperfect.","The author Voltaire--who, slightly off topic, was very handsome.","I mean, very striking eyes.","At any rate, Voltaire had similarly critical and amusing takes; Voltaire's discourtesy to aristocrats eventually got Voltaire sent to the Bastille prison, in fact.","In many rollicking tales, Voltaire made fun of overweening rulers and overweening rulers's endless corruptions.","Voltaire valued honesty and those who lived simple lives “cultivating those who lived simple lives “cultivating their gardens's gardens,” as Voltaire famously put it in Voltaire's satirical novel Candide (1759), which you can learn more about in Crash Course Literature.","Full of horrors and injustice, Candide appeared four years after the Lisbon earthquake, which Voltaire thought was firm evidence that we did not live in the best of all possible worlds.","To replace the old stuffy ways of monarchs and aristocrats, people needed to learn how to embrace the newly-desirable traits of the Enlightenment, like being honest, and inquisitive, and open.","Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau had many ideas about education reform, for instance.","Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau was not a wealthy or titled person but rather was born into a watchmaking family and lived among artisans.","Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau's best-selling novel Emile (1762) describes a boy who grows up not in a city or palace but in a countryside where one can be oneself—a natural individual.","Instead of experiencing common rote learning, with large doses of religious and classical reading, Emile learns carpentry, and gardening, and other practical skills.","In the countryside Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau behaves in the best possible way—naturally and without pretentious airs.","Rousseau promoted what would come to be called middle-class values, like hard work, practicality, and domesticity for women.","When Emile becomes a young man, the spouse chosen for Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau is plump and smiling and devoted to taking care of Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau—not studying or reading or practicing a craft or working hard to support the family like farm women did.","Also, she will breast feed farm women's children, whereas both aristocratic women and busy working women at the time commonly used wet nurses.","As with Emile’s upbringing, all of this is presented as “natural.” Meanwhile, wealthy women in Europe instituted the Enlightenment salon: regular get-togethers in wealthy women in Europe's homes to hear the latest idea, learn about the latest book, or meet the latest philosopher-influencer—called a philosophe in French.","Slightly off topic, but I just love the idea of Rousseau and Voltaire as influencers.","Like, I would have loved to see Rousseau and Voltaire's instagram feeds.","Voltaire’s smoldering selfies, Rousseau’s weird rants written in the notes app and then screenshotted.","It would have been gold.","At any rate, 18th Century Salon goers were often great readers or experimenters with the latest commodities and fashion.","Just like contemporary influencers, actually.","And in terms of fashion, instead of looking to the courts for fashion inspiration, men like Voltaire now sported cottons from India made into handkerchiefs that were worn around the neck, which would soon metamorphose into the necktie).","men like Voltaire also sported banyans—that is loose bathrobe type garments—that did not need corsets, which men traditionally wore.","As Rousseau believed, men should take off men's make-up, wigs, and high heels and be natural—just like people did in other parts of the world.","Just natural man as Just natural man as he is naturally made in the countryside, wearing a Banyan and a feathered hat.","Transformation was in the air for everyone, not just the elites.","Although imported foreign cottons were still illegal in France, for instance, many people now wore imported foreign cottons, including servants, who received cast-off cotton dresses or shirts that were bright and easy to keep clean.","And to help people learn, there were many more texts.","Like in France, there was the Encyclopedie (you’ll notice my amazing French pronunciation).","the Encyclopedie (you’ll notice my amazing French pronunciation) provided discussions of topics such as natural rights and the status of women.","the Encyclopedie (you’ll notice my amazing French pronunciation)'s main editor Denis Diderot wrote: “All things must be examined, debated, investigated without exception and without regard for anyone’s feelings.”[1] Diderot favored social and political reform.","But the Encyclopedie--you know what, I’m gonna just translate the Encyclopedie--you know what, I’m gonna just translate it--Encyclopedia--Encyclopedia, also contained technical drawings of machinery, including machinery for mining.","And technical drawings of machinery, including machinery for mining reflected practical values and also provided a spur to inventiveness and growing prosperity in Europe.","Also, mining, which was already pretty important, was about to become EXTREMELY important, thanks to coal.","In general, Enlightenment aims were more worldly than spiritual.","In Scotland, philosopher David Hume promoted reason above religion, concluding that belief in God was mere superstition.","Some people, called Deists, argued that God existed but that God didn’t influence everyday life after having set the machine of the universe in motion.","Many important “founding fathers” of the United States were deists, and if you believe, as many philosphers did, that God keeps a distance from human affairs, then the persecution of people for people's religious beliefs starts to seem like cruel fanaticism.","And some philosophes became activists.","Like, Voltaire was outraged by the torture of Jean Calas, who had been accused of murdering Voltaire's son to prevent his son from converting to Catholicism.","(Calas’s son had in fact committed suicide due to gambling debts.)","Calas was waterboarded and had every bone in Jean Calas, who had been accused of murdering his son to prevent him from converting to Catholicism's body broken before eventually dying under torture.","Is there a bone back there?","All right, listen.","This is a femur.","I don’t think this is an actual femur, I think it’s, like a recrea--Stan is this a real femur?","It is NOT a real femur.","So I asked our brilliant writer Bonnie if Calas really had every bone in Jean Calas, who had been accused of murdering his son to prevent him from converting to Catholicism's body broken and our brilliant writer Bonnie repsonded, “It’s hard to know whether they got every one,” and then our brilliant writer Bonnie described Calas’s torture to me with a level of detail that led me to conclude that ONE they probably did break every bone in ONE's body, and TWO oh my god torture in 18th century Europe was THE WORST.","So, last thing I’m going to say about this: if you invent a time machine, and I believe absolutely that you can, do not go back in time before like, maybe 2003?","Don’t get me wrong--things are bad, but remember: things used to be so much worse.","Speaking of terrible, let’s talk about slavery.","So, Enlightenment views also fed into rising movements in Britain, France, the Netherlands, and France, the Netherlands, and their colonies's colonies to abolish slavery.","By this time, the slave trade was massive and there was growing acknowledgement of the slave trade's cruelt.","In 1770, the French Catholic abbé (or, clergyman) Guillaume Raynal laid out the violent devastation of native peoples by invading Europeans.","And in 1788 the freed slave Olaudah Equiano described the middle passage after the freed slave Olaudah Equiano had been kidnapped in present-day Nigeria and enslaved.","Now Equiano is often believed to have been born in South Carolina, and the freed slave Olaudah Equiano's riveting memoir may have been cobbled together from the harrowing tales of others.","Still, his riveting memoir was a bestseller.","his riveting memoir captured the inhumanity of whites towards blacks, advocated Enlightenment freedom and human rights for all.","his riveting memoir also stirred freedmen and slaves to struggle for abolition.","And there was also growing movements for other kinds of freedom.","The Scotsman Adam Smith took on the mercantilist theory that global wealth was static and states could only increase wealth by taking wealth from others when The Scotsman Adam Smith rejected ideas about stockpiling gold, and refusing entry of goods into one’s country, and also remaining a subsistence agricultural economy with serfs.","The Scotsman Adam Smith advocated for manufacturing, the division of labor, and free trade.","In a free or laissez-faire market, an individual would work and interact with others in the economy on the basis of others's self-interest.","And the sum of all self-interests would make for a balanced, harmonious, and prosperous society.","Smith is best known as the father of the free market, free trade, and individualism thanks to The Scotsman Adam Smith's 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations.","But The Scotsman Adam Smith also opposed absolutism and urged concern for the overall well-being of society.","In addition to the benefits of laissez-faire that The Scotsman Adam Smith saw, Smith saw the potential harms, so The Scotsman Adam Smith also argued for healing social policies.","Another important Enlightenment book was Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s The Social Contract, which famously begins “Man is born free and everywhere Man is in chains.” Rousseau picked up on John Locke’s theme of the contract that individuals made with one another to form a state or nation.","And Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s believed that Once freely formed, the state embodied the best that was in the collective community; thus individuals needed to give the state unconditional obedience because the state represented the “general will.” Today, thinkers see that this call for obedience to the general will planted the seeds of dictatorial governments in the twentieth century and beyond.","But, Rousseau did also emphasize individual sentiments as valuable.","At the opposite end of Rousseau’s “general will” was German philosopher Emmanuel Kant’s attention to individual reason.","German philosopher Emmanuel Kant’s famously exclaimed, “Dare to Know” as German philosopher Emmanuel Kant’s advanced the Enlightenment’s commitment to the human mind and the ability of every person to think for every person instead of simply obeying old commands and ideas.","The human mind, German philosopher Emmanuel Kant’s argued, housed “categories of understanding” with which information interacted to produce purely rational judgments.","And in this way, Kant shared the faith in the individual of both Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith, and we can trace our own culture’s individualism back to the Enlightenment.","And many other individuals took refuge in Enlightenment thought as well as taking Enlightenment thought as a call to action.","Upper-class Jewish women across Europe found the world of ideas so inspiring that Upper-class Jewish women across Europe began salons, too.","In Berlin, Upper-class Jewish women across Europe established nine of the fourteen salons in the city.","And philosopher and author Moses Mendelssohn used the more tolerant atmosphere to express philosopher and author Moses Mendelssohn's optimism about the future of Jews in Europe.","Because of the Enlightenment emphasis on reason, philosopher and author Moses Mendelssohn believed that the age-old persecution of Jews would soon end.","Of course, we now know that that wasn’t the case.","And much exploitation and oppression has taken place in the guise of reasoned thought.","Pseudoscientific “reason” has been used to justify many forms of structural inequality, from racism to sexism to class systems.","Rationality would not prove to be a way out of the human urge to create and marginalize outsiders.","But Enlightenment thought was nonetheless transformative, and seeking worldly explanations for inequality and injustice did have significant real-world consequences.","I mean, no longer would we see Earthquakes merely as acts of God.","Enlightenment challenges to the idea that we already were living in the best of all possible worlds would help us to imagine, and eventually live in, better worlds--albeit ones that are still profoundly imperfect.","Thanks for watching.","I’ll see you next time.","________________ [1] Quoted in Lynn Hunt et al., The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures, 6th ed.","(Boston: Bedford St. Martins,

[[TV-Montesquieu]] One of the first ways writers criticized outmoded ways of life was to make fun of them...writers like Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, aka Just Montesquieu. (He really was the person to criticize outmoded ways of life because, boy did he have an outmoded name.) Montesquieu was a jurist who owned an estate near Bordeaux, which still makes wine under his name, and in 1721, he published the Persian Letters in which Uzbek visitors find Europe amusing if not shocking. The visitors, for instance, are amazed at the magic of priests who somehow perform the trick of turning wine into blood. And although they clearly see the problems in French society, they firmly adhere to the mustiness of their own ways, such as keeping women secluded in a harem and guarded by eunuchs. The message was that both easterners and Europeans were imperfect. The author Voltaire--who, slightly off topic, was very handsome. I mean, very striking eyes. At any rate, he had similarly critical and amusing takes; his discourtesy to aristocrats eventually got him sent to the Bastille prison, in fact. In many rollicking tales, he made fun of overweening rulers and their endless corruptions. He valued honesty and those who lived simple lives “cultivating their gardens,” as he famously put it in his satirical novel Candide (1759), which you can learn more about in Crash Course Literature. Full of horrors and injustice, Candide appeared four years after the Lisbon earthquake, which Voltaire thought was firm evidence that we did not live in the best of all possible worlds. To replace the old stuffy ways of monarchs and aristocrats, people needed to learn how to embrace the newly-desirable traits of the Enlightenment, like being honest, and inquisitive, and open. Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau had many ideas about education reform, for instance. He was not a wealthy or titled person but rather was born into a watchmaking family and lived among artisans. His best-selling novel Emile (1762) describes a boy who grows up not in a city or palace but in a countryside where one can be oneself—a natural individual. Instead of experiencing common rote learning, with large doses of religious and classical reading, Emile learns carpentry, and gardening, and other practical skills. In the countryside he behaves in the best possible way—naturally and without pretentious airs. Rousseau promoted what would come to be called middle-class values, like hard work, practicality, and domesticity for women. When Emile becomes a young man, the spouse chosen for him is plump and smiling and devoted to taking care of him—not studying or reading or practicing a craft or working hard to support the family like farm women did. Also, she will breast feed their children, whereas both aristocratic women and busy working women at the time commonly used wet nurses. As with Emile’s upbringing, all of this is presented as “natural.” Meanwhile, wealthy women in Europe instituted the Enlightenment salon: regular get-togethers in their homes to hear the latest idea, learn about the latest book, or meet the latest philosopher-influencer—called a philosophe in French. Slightly off topic, but I just love the idea of Rousseau and Voltaire as influencers. Like, I would have loved to see their instagram feeds. Voltaire’s smoldering selfies, Rousseau’s weird rants written in the notes app and then screenshotted. It would have been gold. At any rate, 18th Century Salon goers were often great readers or experimenters with the latest commodities and fashion. Just like contemporary influencers, actually. And in terms of fashion, instead of looking to the courts for fashion inspiration, men like Voltaire now sported cottons from India made into handkerchiefs that were worn around the neck, which would soon metamorphose into the necktie). They also sported banyans—that is loose bathrobe type garments—that did not need corsets, which men traditionally wore. As Rousseau believed, men should take off their make-up, wigs, and high heels and be natural—just like people did in other parts of the world. Just natural man as he is naturally made in the countryside, wearing a Banyan and a feathered hat. Transformation was in the air for everyone, not just the elites. Although imported foreign cottons were still illegal in France, for instance, many people now wore them, including servants, who received cast-off cotton dresses or shirts that were bright and easy to keep clean. And to help people learn, there were many more texts. Like in France, there was the Encyclopedie (you’ll notice my amazing French pronunciation). It provided discussions of topics such as natural rights and the status of women. Its main editor Denis Diderot wrote: “All things must be examined, debated, investigated without exception and without regard for anyone’s feelings.”[1] Diderot favored social and political reform. But the Encyclopedie--you know what, I’m gonna just translate it--Encyclopedia, also contained technical drawings of machinery, including machinery for mining. And that reflected practical values and also provided a spur to inventiveness and growing prosperity in Europe. Also, mining, which was already pretty important, was about to become EXTREMELY important, thanks to coal. In general, Enlightenment aims were more worldly than spiritual. In Scotland, philosopher David Hume promoted reason above religion, concluding that belief in God was mere superstition. Some people, called Deists, argued that God existed but that he didn’t influence everyday life after having set the machine of the universe in motion. Many important “founding fathers” of the United States were deists, and if you believe, as many philosphers did, that God keeps a distance from human affairs, then the persecution of people for their religious beliefs starts to seem like cruel fanaticism. And some philosophes became activists. Like, Voltaire was outraged by the torture of Jean Calas, who had been accused of murdering his son to prevent him from converting to Catholicism. (Calas’s son had in fact committed suicide due to gambling debts.) Calas was waterboarded and had every bone in his body broken before eventually dying under torture. Is there a bone back there? All right, listen. This is a femur. I don’t think this is an actual femur, I think it’s, like a recrea--Stan is this a real femur? It is NOT a real femur. So I asked our brilliant writer Bonnie if Calas really had every bone in his body broken and she repsonded, “It’s hard to know whether they got every one,” and then she described Calas’s torture to me with a level of detail that led me to conclude that ONE they probably did break every bone in his body, and TWO oh my god torture in 18th century Europe was THE WORST. So, last thing I’m going to say about this: if you invent a time machine, and I believe absolutely that you can, do not go back in time before like, maybe 2003? Don’t get me wrong--things are bad, but remember: they used to be so much worse. Speaking of terrible, let’s talk about slavery. So, Enlightenment views also fed into rising movements in Britain, France, the Netherlands, and their colonies to abolish slavery. By this time, the slave trade was massive and there was growing acknowledgement of its cruelt. In 1770, the French Catholic abbé (or, clergyman) Guillaume Raynal laid out the violent devastation of native peoples by invading Europeans. And in 1788 the freed slave Olaudah Equiano described the middle passage after he had been kidnapped in present-day Nigeria and enslaved. Now Equiano is often believed to have been born in South Carolina, and his riveting memoir may have been cobbled together from the harrowing tales of others. Still, it was a bestseller. It captured the inhumanity of whites towards blacks, advocated Enlightenment freedom and human rights for all. It also stirred freedmen and slaves to struggle for abolition. And there was also growing movements for other kinds of freedom. The Scotsman Adam Smith took on the mercantilist theory that global wealth was static and states could only increase wealth by taking it from others when he rejected ideas about stockpiling gold, and refusing entry of goods into one’s country, and also remaining a subsistence agricultural economy with serfs. He advocated for manufacturing, the division of labor, and free trade. In a free or laissez-faire market, an individual would work and interact with others in the economy on the basis of their self-interest. And the sum of all self-interests would make for a balanced, harmonious, and prosperous society. Smith is best known as the father of the free market, free trade, and individualism thanks to his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations. But he also opposed absolutism and urged concern for the overall well-being of society. In addition to the benefits of laissez-faire that he saw, Smith saw the potential harms, so he also argued for healing social policies. Another important Enlightenment book was Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s The Social Contract, which famously begins “Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains.” Rousseau picked up on John Locke’s theme of the contract that individuals made with one another to form a state or nation. And he believed that Once freely formed, the state embodied the best that was in the collective community; thus individuals needed to give the state unconditional obedience because it represented the “general will.” Today, thinkers see that this call for obedience to the general will planted the seeds of dictatorial governments in the twentieth century and beyond. But, Rousseau did also emphasize individual sentiments as valuable. At the opposite end of Rousseau’s “general will” was German philosopher Emmanuel Kant’s attention to individual reason. He famously exclaimed, “Dare to Know” as he advanced the Enlightenment’s commitment to the human mind and the ability of every person to think for themselves instead of simply obeying old commands and ideas. The human mind, he argued, housed “categories of understanding” with which information interacted to produce purely rational judgments. And in this way, Kant shared the faith in the individual of both Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith, and we can trace our own culture’s individualism back to the Enlightenment. And many other individuals took refuge in Enlightenment thought as well as taking it as a call to action. Upper-class Jewish women across Europe found the world of ideas so inspiring that they began salons, too. In Berlin, they established nine of the fourteen salons in the city. And philosopher and author Moses Mendelssohn used the more tolerant atmosphere to express his optimism about the future of Jews in Europe. Because of the Enlightenment emphasis on reason, he believed that the age-old persecution of Jews would soon end. Of course, we now know that that wasn’t the case. And much exploitation and oppression has taken place in the guise of reasoned thought. Pseudoscientific “reason” has been used to justify many forms of structural inequality, from racism to sexism to class systems. Rationality would not prove to be a way out of the human urge to create and marginalize outsiders. But Enlightenment thought was nonetheless transformative, and seeking worldly explanations for inequality and injustice did have significant real-world consequences. I mean, no longer would we see Earthquakes merely as acts of God. Enlightenment challenges to the idea that we already were living in the best of all possible worlds would help us to imagine, and eventually live in, better worlds--albeit ones that are still profoundly imperfect. Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next time. ________________ [1] Quoted in Lynn Hunt et al., The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures, 6th ed. (Boston: Bedford St. Martins, 2019) 616.'
ERROR:root:orig input: ' Hi I’m John Green and this is Crash Course European History. So far, we’ve seen a ton of political change and continuing warfare in the midst of the seventeenth century’s little ice age, and history often focuses on these types of political and military stories, but there were also other changes occurring: shifts in how people perceived the everyday world. The linking of phenomena like earthquakes and eclipses with human events goes back a very long way, like to the beginning of our species, as does the belief that supernatural forces are deeply shaping the lives of individual humans. For instance, in a previous video about witchcraft, we discussed how earthquake tremors in Istanbul in 1648 were seen as portents of a sultan’s death a few months later. But a century after that, a huge earthquake struck Lisbon, Portugal on All Saints’ Day of 1755. Tens of thousands of people died, many from a tsunami that followed the quake. Now, some theologians argued this was punishment from God for the world’s sins, but others pointed out that the earthquake had destroyed a lot of churches while sparing a lot of brothels. Voltaire wrote a famous poem in response to the earthquake that included the memorable lines “As the dying voices call out, will you dare respond to this appalling spectacle of smoking ashes with, “This is the necessary effect of the eternal laws Freely chosen by God?” The way Europeans were looking at the world had changed between the Istanbul earthquake and the Lisbon one: The Enlightenment was thriving. [Intro] So, today we want to emphasize that the Enlightenment wasn’t all high fallutin’ calculations of the sun’s orbit or theories about the mathematical laws of the universe or for that matter theories about earthquake causality. It also considered more down-to-earth situations like how people of different social classes relate to one another, how trade and manufacturing should function, and what the relationship of ordinary people should be to their government. The Enlightenment or Age of Light refers to the belief that the musty old ideas needed to be exposed to rational investigation to see if they were still valuable. The bright light of reason needed to shine on tradition. And this momentous challenge to tradition came about during a time in which Europe was being completely transformed in many ways that are sometimes forgotten amid all the excitement about Voltaire and reason. So let’s go straight to the Thought Bubble today. 1. Beyond the wars and state-building we’ve already seen, 2. increasing abundance and novelty was creeping into the everyday lives of Europeans. 3. Coffee, tea, chocolate, tobacco, and other commodities led to experimentation. 4. For instance, one English housewife saw tea for the first time and thought it was meant to be baked as a kind of pie filling. 5. A diplomat said that tea and coffee had brought a greater “sobriety” and “civility” to everyday life in Europe. 6. Europe had previously been a land of famine and mere subsistence for essentially all of its history. 7. But now the cultivation of new foods from the Americas like potatoes and corn, 8. along with literally thousands of other new plants, meant that available calories were increasing, 9. And it also introduced the idea that maybe the world didn’t have to be perpetually on the brink of starvation and catastrophe. 10. Also, by this time, tens of thousands of Europeans had traveled the world, and had experienced other social orders first hand. 11. For instance, travelers discovered that people across Asia didn’t seem as quarrelsome as Europeans. 12. Drivers of carts did not block narrow streets for hours arguing over who had the right of way. 13. They politely agreed to let one or the other pass. 14. They also saw that not all social orders were as hierarchical as most European ones, 15. and that some societies even gave less weight to a person’s parentage 16. and more to that person’s individual skills and talents.

ice age, and history often focuses on these types of political and military stories, but there were also other changes occurring: shifts in how people perceived the everyday world.","The linking of phenomena like earthquakes and eclipses with human events goes back a very long way, like to the beginning of our species, as does the belief that supernatural forces are deeply shaping the lives of individual humans.","For instance, in a previous video about witchcraft, we discussed how earthquake tremors in Istanbul in 1648 were seen as portents of a sultan’s death a few months later.","But a century after that, a huge earthquake struck Lisbon, Portugal on All Saints’ Day of 1755.","Tens of thousands of people died, many from a tsunami that followed the quake.","Now, some theologians argued this was punishment from God for the world’s sins, but others pointed out that the earthquake had destroyed a lot of churches while sparing a lot of brothels.","Voltaire wrote a famous poem in response to the earthquake that included the memorable lines “As the dying voices call out, will you dare respond to this appalling spectacle of smoking ashes with, “This is the necessary effect of the eternal laws Freely chosen by God?”","The way Europeans were looking at the world had changed between the Istanbul earthquake and the Lisbon one: The Enlightenment was thriving.","[Intro]","So, today we want to emphasize that the Enlightenment wasn’t all high fallutin’ calculations of the sun’s orbit or theories about the mathematical laws of the universe or for that matter theories about earthquake causality.","The Enlightenment also considered more down-to-earth situations like how people of different social classes relate to one another, how trade and manufacturing should function, and what the relationship of ordinary people should be to ordinary people's government.","The Enlightenment or Age of Light refers to the belief that the musty old ideas needed to be exposed to rational investigation to see if the musty old ideas were still valuable.","The bright light of reason needed to shine on tradition.","And this momentous challenge to tradition came about during a time in which Europe was being completely transformed in many ways that are sometimes forgotten amid all the excitement about Voltaire and reason.","So let’s go straight to the Thought Bubble today.","1.","Beyond the wars and state-building we’ve already seen, 2.","increasing abundance and novelty was creeping into the everyday lives of Europeans.","3.","Coffee, tea, chocolate, tobacco, and other commodities led to experimentation.","4.","For instance, one English housewife saw tea for the first time and thought tea was meant to be baked as a kind of pie filling.","5.","A diplomat said that tea and coffee had brought a greater “sobriety” and “civility” to everyday life in Europe.","6.","Europe had previously been a land of famine and mere subsistence for essentially all of Europe's history.","7.","But now the cultivation of new foods from the Americas like potatoes and corn, 8.","along with literally thousands of other new plants, meant that available calories were increasing, 9.","And the cultivation of new foods from the Americas like potatoes and corn also introduced the idea that maybe the world didn’t have to be perpetually on the brink of starvation and catastrophe.","10.","Also, by this time, tens of thousands of Europeans had traveled the world, and had experienced other social orders first hand.","11.","For instance, travelers discovered that people across Asia didn’t seem as quarrelsome as Europeans.","12.","Drivers of carts did not block narrow streets for hours arguing over who had the right of way.","13.","Drivers of carts politely agreed to let one or the other pass.","14.","Drivers of carts also saw that not all social orders were as hierarchical as most European ones, 15.","and that some societies even gave less weight to a person’s parentage 16.","and more to a person’s's individual skills and talents.","Thanks Thought Bubble.","[[TV-Montesquieu]]","One of the first ways writers criticized outmoded ways of life was to make fun of outmoded ways of life...","writers like Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, aka Just Montesquieu.","(Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, aka Just Montesquieu really was the person to criticize outmoded ways of life because, boy did Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu,","aka Just Montesquieu have an outmoded name.)","Montesquieu was a jurist who owned an estate near Bordeaux, which still makes wine under Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, aka Just Montesquieu's name, and in 1721, Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, aka Just Montesquieu published the Persian Letters in which Uzbek visitors find Europe amusing if not shocking.","The visitors, for instance, are amazed at the magic of priests who somehow perform the trick of turning wine into blood.","And although Uzbek visitors clearly see the problems in French society, Uzbek visitors firmly adhere to the mustiness of Uzbek visitors's own ways, such as keeping women secluded in a harem and guarded by eunuchs.","The message was that both easterners and Europeans were imperfect.","The author Voltaire--who, slightly off topic, was very handsome.","I mean, very striking eyes.","At any rate, Voltaire had similarly critical and amusing takes; Voltaire's discourtesy to aristocrats eventually got Voltaire sent to the Bastille prison, in fact.","In many rollicking tales, Voltaire made fun of overweening rulers and overweening rulers's endless corruptions.","Voltaire valued honesty and those who lived simple lives “cultivating those who lived simple lives “cultivating their gardens's gardens,” as Voltaire famously put it in Voltaire's satirical novel Candide (1759), which you can learn more about in Crash Course Literature.","Full of horrors and injustice, Candide appeared four years after the Lisbon earthquake, which Voltaire thought was firm evidence that we did not live in the best of all possible worlds.","To replace the old stuffy ways of monarchs and aristocrats, people needed to learn how to embrace the newly-desirable traits of the Enlightenment, like being honest, and inquisitive, and open.","Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau had many ideas about education reform, for instance.","Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau was not a wealthy or titled person but rather was born into a watchmaking family and lived among artisans.","Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau's best-selling novel Emile (1762) describes a boy who grows up not in a city or palace but in a countryside where one can be oneself—a natural individual.","Instead of experiencing common rote learning, with large doses of religious and classical reading, Emile learns carpentry, and gardening, and other practical skills.","In the countryside Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau behaves in the best possible way—naturally and without pretentious airs.","Rousseau promoted what would come to be called middle-class values, like hard work, practicality, and domesticity for women.","When Emile becomes a young man, the spouse chosen for Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau is plump and smiling and devoted to taking care of Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau—not studying or reading or practicing a craft or working hard to support the family like farm women did.","Also, she will breast feed farm women's children, whereas both aristocratic women and busy working women at the time commonly used wet nurses.","As with Emile’s upbringing, all of this is presented as “natural.”","Meanwhile, wealthy women in Europe instituted the Enlightenment salon: regular get-togethers in wealthy women in Europe's homes to hear the latest idea, learn about the latest book, or meet the latest philosopher-influencer—called a philosophe in French.","Slightly off topic, but I just love the idea of Rousseau and Voltaire as influencers.","Like, I would have loved to see Rousseau and Voltaire's instagram feeds.","Voltaire’s smoldering selfies, Rousseau’s weird rants written in the notes app and then screenshotted.","It would have been gold.","At any rate, 18th Century Salon goers were often great readers or experimenters with the latest commodities and fashion.","Just like contemporary influencers, actually.","And in terms of fashion, instead of looking to the courts for fashion inspiration, men like Voltaire now sported cottons from India made into handkerchiefs that were worn around the neck, which would soon metamorphose into the necktie).","men like Voltaire also sported banyans—that is loose bathrobe type garments—that did not need corsets, which men traditionally wore.","As Rousseau believed, men should take off men's make-up, wigs, and high heels and be natural—just like people did in other parts of the world.","Just natural man as Just natural man as he is naturally made in the countryside, wearing a Banyan and a feathered hat.","Transformation was in the air for everyone, not just the elites.","Although imported foreign cottons were still illegal in France, for instance, many people now wore imported foreign cottons, including servants, who received cast-off cotton dresses or shirts that were bright and easy to keep clean.","And to help people learn, there were many more texts.","Like in France, there was the Encyclopedie (you’ll notice my amazing French pronunciation).","the Encyclopedie (you’ll notice my amazing French pronunciation) provided discussions of topics such as natural rights and the status of women.","the Encyclopedie (you’ll notice my amazing French pronunciation)'s main editor Denis Diderot wrote: “All things must be examined, debated, investigated without exception and without regard for anyone’s feelings.”[1]","Diderot favored social and political reform.","But the Encyclopedie--you know what, I’m gonna just translate the Encyclopedie--you know what, I’m gonna just translate it--Encyclopedia--Encyclopedia, also contained technical drawings of machinery, including machinery for mining.","And technical drawings of machinery, including machinery for mining reflected practical values and also provided a spur to inventiveness and growing prosperity in Europe.","Also, mining, which was already pretty important, was about to become EXTREMELY important, thanks to coal.","In general, Enlightenment aims were more worldly than spiritual.","In Scotland, philosopher David Hume promoted reason above religion, concluding that belief in God was mere superstition.","Some people, called Deists, argued that God existed but that God didn’t influence everyday life after having set the machine of the universe in motion.","Many important “founding fathers” of the United States were deists, and if you believe, as many philosphers did, that God keeps a distance from human affairs, then the persecution of people for people's religious beliefs starts to seem like cruel fanaticism.","And some philosophes became activists.","Like, Voltaire was outraged by the torture of Jean Calas, who had been accused of murdering Voltaire's son to prevent his son from converting to Catholicism.","(Calas’s son had in fact committed suicide due to gambling debts.)","Calas was waterboarded and had every bone in Jean Calas, who had been accused of murdering his son to prevent him from converting to Catholicism's body broken before eventually dying under torture.","Is there a bone back there?","All right, listen.","This is a femur.","I don’t think this is an actual femur, I think it’s, like a recrea--Stan is this a real femur?","It is NOT a real femur.","So I asked our brilliant writer Bonnie if Calas really had every bone in Jean Calas, who had been accused of murdering his son to prevent him from converting to Catholicism's body broken and our brilliant writer Bonnie repsonded, “","It’s hard to know whether they got every one,” and then our brilliant writer Bonnie described Calas’s torture to me with a level of detail that led me to conclude that ONE they probably did break every bone in ONE's body, and TWO","oh","my god torture in 18th century","Europe was THE WORST.","So, last thing I’m going to say about this: if you invent a time machine, and I believe absolutely that you can, do not go back in time before like, maybe 2003?","Don’t get me wrong--things are bad, but remember: things used to be so much worse.","Speaking of terrible, let’s talk about slavery.","So, Enlightenment views also fed into rising movements in Britain, France, the Netherlands, and France, the Netherlands, and their colonies's colonies to abolish slavery.","By this time, the slave trade was massive and there was growing acknowledgement of the slave trade's cruelt.","In 1770, the French Catholic abbé (or, clergyman)","Guillaume Raynal laid out the violent devastation of native peoples by invading Europeans.","And in 1788 the freed slave Olaudah Equiano described the middle passage after the freed slave Olaudah Equiano had been kidnapped in present-day Nigeria and enslaved.","Now Equiano is often believed to have been born in South Carolina, and the freed slave Olaudah Equiano's riveting memoir may have been cobbled together from the harrowing tales of others.","Still, his riveting memoir was a bestseller.","his riveting memoir captured the inhumanity of whites towards blacks, advocated Enlightenment freedom and human rights for all.","his riveting memoir also stirred freedmen and slaves to struggle for abolition.","And there was also growing movements for other kinds of freedom.","The Scotsman Adam Smith took on the mercantilist theory that global wealth was static and states could only increase wealth by taking wealth from others when The Scotsman Adam Smith rejected ideas about stockpiling gold, and refusing entry of goods into one’s country, and also remaining a subsistence agricultural economy with serfs.","The Scotsman Adam Smith advocated for manufacturing, the division of labor, and free trade.","In a free or laissez-faire market, an individual would work and interact with others in the economy on the basis of others's self-interest.","And the sum of all self-interests would make for a balanced, harmonious, and prosperous society.","Smith is best known as the father of the free market, free trade, and individualism thanks to The Scotsman Adam Smith's 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations.","But The Scotsman Adam Smith also opposed absolutism and urged concern for the overall well-being of society.","In addition to the benefits of laissez-faire that The Scotsman Adam Smith saw, Smith saw the potential harms, so The Scotsman Adam Smith also argued for healing social policies.","Another important Enlightenment book was Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s","The Social Contract, which famously begins “Man is born free and everywhere Man is in chains.”","Rousseau picked up on John Locke’s theme of the contract that individuals made with one another to form a state or nation.","And Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s believed that Once freely formed, the state embodied the best that was in the collective community; thus individuals needed to give the state unconditional obedience because the state represented the “general will.”","Today, thinkers see that this call for obedience to the general will planted the seeds of dictatorial governments in the twentieth century and beyond.","But, Rousseau did also emphasize individual sentiments as valuable.","At the opposite end of Rousseau’s “general will” was German philosopher Emmanuel Kant’s attention to individual reason.","German philosopher Emmanuel Kant’s famously exclaimed, “Dare to Know” as German philosopher Emmanuel Kant’s advanced the Enlightenment’s commitment to the human mind and the ability of every person to think for every person instead of simply obeying old commands and ideas.","The human mind, German philosopher Emmanuel Kant’s argued, housed “categories of understanding” with which information interacted to produce purely rational judgments.","And in this way, Kant shared the faith in the individual of both Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith, and we can trace our own culture’s individualism back to the Enlightenment.","And many other individuals took refuge in Enlightenment thought as well as taking Enlightenment thought as a call to action.","Upper-class Jewish women across Europe found the world of ideas so inspiring that Upper-class Jewish women across Europe began salons, too.","In Berlin, Upper-class Jewish women across Europe established nine of the fourteen salons in the city.","And philosopher and author Moses Mendelssohn used the more tolerant atmosphere to express philosopher and author Moses Mendelssohn's optimism about the future of Jews in Europe.","Because of the Enlightenment emphasis on reason, philosopher and author Moses Mendelssohn believed that the age-old persecution of Jews would soon end.","Of course, we now know that that wasn’t the case.","And much exploitation and oppression has taken place in the guise of reasoned thought.","Pseudoscientific “reason” has been used to justify many forms of structural inequality, from racism to sexism to class systems.","Rationality would not prove to be a way out of the human urge to create and marginalize outsiders.","But Enlightenment thought was nonetheless transformative, and seeking worldly explanations for inequality and injustice did have significant real-world consequences.","I mean, no longer would we see Earthquakes merely as acts of God.","Enlightenment challenges to the idea that we already were living in the best of all possible worlds would help us to imagine, and eventually live in, better worlds--albeit ones that are still profoundly imperfect.","Thanks for watching.","I’ll see you next

ERROR:root:payload: 'A bit earlier in the series we talked\xa0 about the origin of multicellular life.\xa0\xa0 We discussed choanoflagellates and sponges,\xa0\xa0 noting that these represent the emergence\xa0 of animal life around 600 million years ago.\xa0\xa0 Since organisms resembling modern sponges are\xa0 likely the ancestors of all the animals on Earth,\xa0\xa0 it is with such organisms that we will\xa0 begin our exploration of the animal kingdom.\xa0 Sponges are members of phylum Porifera. The name\xa0 “Porifera” means “pore bearer,” which is very\xa0\xa0 fitting for sponges since they’re full of pores,\xa0 or ostia. Tiny little holes cover their bodies.\xa0\xa0 But this isn’t the only unique aspect of sponges. Not only are sponges almost all asymmetrical, with\xa0\xa0 just a few exhibiting radial symmetry, but their\xa0 cells do not organize into tissues or organs. They\xa0\xa0 don’t even have a mouth or anus, so there is no\xa0 digestive tract. Instead, their unique body shapes\xa0\xa0 are adapted to allow for maximal efficiency of\xa0 water flow through their central cavity, where the\xa0\xa0 water deposits nutrients and then leaves through\xa0 a hole on their top end called the osculum,\xa0\xa0 meaning “little mouth.” Some species might\xa0 have several oscula, though most have just one.\xa0 The bodies of sponges are made of two thin layers\xa0 of cells with a jelly-like mesohyl sandwiched\xa0\xa0 between them, which is primarily composed of\xa0 collagen. The outer layer of a sponge is covered\xa0\xa0 in a single-layer of external “skin” composed\xa0 of flat plate-like cells called pinacocytes.\xa0\xa0 Pinacocytes at the base of the animal also anchor\xa0 it to its substrate, the thing it is stuck to,\xa0\xa0 while those that form its “skin” can serve not\xa0 only to protect it, but also to digest organic\xa0\xa0 material. However, the cells most responsible for\xa0 feeding are choanocytes. These are cylindrical\xa0\xa0 cells with a single flagellum. It is the whip-like\xa0 motion of these flagella that are responsible\xa0\xa0 for creating a current to drive water through a\xa0 sponge’s body. So an important thing to understand\xa0\xa0 is that sponges don’t “suck in” water, instead\xa0 their insides are lined with tiny flagella-bearing\xa0\xa0 choanocytes that literally create a current around\xa0 them. This current isn’t strong enough to bring in\xa0\xa0 large animals, but tiny living creatures and\xa0 organic material are easily swept into it.\xa0 So, the flagella whip back and forth causing a\xa0 current around the sponge. The water around the\xa0\xa0 sponge is drawn into its pores, which are lined\xa0 and controlled by porocytes that create closable\xa0\xa0 valves. In addition, there are other cells\xa0 found within the mesohyl, like the sclerocytes,\xa0\xa0 or spongocytes in the demosponges, which excrete\xa0 spicules, the structural element of sponges\xa0\xa0 that also deter predators. Many sponges can shed\xa0 their spicules, forming a dense carpet of spines\xa0\xa0 around them. Other species produce toxins that\xa0 prevent other sessile organisms, such as bryozoans\xa0\xa0 or sea squirts, from growing on or near them. Many species of sponge also have a variety of\xa0\xa0 other cells that move through their mesohyl.\xa0 They have oocytes and spermatocytes,\xa0\xa0 which are the reproductive cells, grey cells,\xa0 which act like immune cells in other animals,\xa0\xa0 amoebocytes, which are amoeba-like totipotent\xa0 cells that can transform into any other type\xa0\xa0 of cell, and others like myocytes, which\xa0 conduct signals and allow parts of the\xa0\xa0 animal to contract, as well as several types of\xa0 collagen-producing cells. Many of these cells,\xa0\xa0 excluding the sclerocytes, can actually\xa0 move and drift freely in the sponge mesohyl.\xa0\xa0 If you look closely at some of these cells, they\xa0 look and behave almost like individual protozoa,\xa0\xa0 which supports what we learned about the emergence\xa0 of multicellular life in an earlier tutorial.\xa0 Now, something fascinating about sponges is\xa0 that since they lack any true digestive system,\xa0\xa0 almost every one of their\xa0 cells consumes organic matter.\xa0\xa0 So as water is flowing into their bodies, any\xa0 tiny organic material such as phytoplankton and\xa0\xa0 detritus that is trapped by a part of the sponge\xa0 is consumed. This is a type of “filter feeding”\xa0\xa0 since the sponges only consume organic material\xa0 suspended in the water column. However,\xa0\xa0 there are sponges, like the ping-pong\xa0 tree sponge, that are carnivorous.\xa0\xa0 This uses tiny, hooked spicules to capture\xa0 small crustaceans and slowly digest them alive.\xa0 This carnivorous behavior is fascinating for\xa0 sponges since as adults, these organisms are\xa0\xa0 sessile, meaning they anchor themselves to a\xa0 substrate and grow from there. Some sponges\xa0\xa0 have taken this behavior to the next level, and\xa0 actually house photosynthesizing endosymbionts\xa0\xa0 within their bodies. These few species produce\xa0 more food and oxygen than they consume,\xa0\xa0 like plants. But remember, they’re still\xa0 animals. Their bodies capture the endosymbionts,\xa0\xa0 they can’t grow them on their own. Also, they,\xa0 like all species of sponge, are mobile as larvae.\xa0 Speaking of larvae, or baby sponges,\xa0 let’s talk about sponge reproduction.\xa0\xa0 The most common form of reproduction in sponges is\xa0 sexual. They release sperm cells into the water.\xa0\xa0 In some species, ova, or eggs,\xa0 are also released into the water,\xa0\xa0 while in others they are held within the bodies\xa0 of the sponge, hoping to be fertilized by a sperm\xa0\xa0 cell from a different organism belonging to the\xa0 same species. It’s important to note that while\xa0\xa0 most sponges are hermaphrodites, that is, they are\xa0 male and female at the same time, they don’t have\xa0\xa0 gonads, or reproductive organs. Sperm and\xa0 eggs are instead produced by individual cells.\xa0 Once an egg cell is fertilized it develops into a\xa0 zygote and then into one of four types of larvae.\xa0\xa0 All of them are basically tiny cell balls with\xa0 flagella that line their epidermis. These larvae\xa0\xa0 will then swim for a few days. Fascinatingly,\xa0 many of these larval sponges possess “pigment\xa0\xa0 ring eyes” that are sensitive to light, and can\xa0 mediate their locomotion. Eventually though,\xa0\xa0 they will sink in the water column and then\xa0 crawl until they find a place to settle.\xa0\xa0 From there they will slowly grow into adults. Many sponge species can also asexually reproduce\xa0\xa0 using one of three different methods, those\xa0 being budding, fragmentation, and gemmules.\xa0\xa0 Contrary to popular belief, only a few species\xa0 of sponges can reproduce asexually by budding,\xa0\xa0 where a new sponge develops from an outgrowth, or\xa0 bud, on the parent sponge, which then drops off.\xa0 Fragmentation, however, is a bit more common.\xa0 All known living sponges can remold their bodies.\xa0\xa0 Fragmentation is when a sponge regenerates\xa0 from fragments that are broken off,\xa0\xa0 although this only works if the fragments include\xa0 the right types of cells, like the totipotent\xa0\xa0 amoebocytes. It’s true that some sponges can\xa0 completely regenerate from a single cell,\xa0\xa0 but it must be the right cell. Not all sponge\xa0 cells, and not all sponge species can do this.\xa0 The third method of asexual reproduction\xa0 is through gemmules. When environmental\xa0\xa0 conditions become less hospitable to\xa0 the sponges, like if temperatures drop,\xa0\xa0 many freshwater species and a few marine\xa0 ones produce gemmules, which are like tiny\xa0\xa0 survival pods of unspecialized cells that\xa0 can remain dormant until conditions improve.\xa0\xa0 Then they either form completely new sponges or\xa0 recolonize the skeletons of their dead parents.\xa0 To finish up, let’s go over the most common body\xa0 structures, also known as aquiferous systems\xa0\xa0 of sponges, and their extant taxonomic classes.\xa0 There are three main sponge structures. First, the\xa0\xa0 simple tube or vase shape lined with choanocytes\xa0 known as asconoid. Second, the syconoid,\xa0\xa0 or pleated body wall, that has inner pockets\xa0 lined with choanocytes, which connect to the outer\xa0\xa0 pockets. And third, the complex leuconoid pattern,\xa0 with mesohyl that contains a network of chambers\xa0\xa0 lined with choanocytes, connected to each other\xa0 and to the water intakes and outlet by tubes. This\xa0\xa0 third body type is actually the most common. Less\xa0 common body structures are the sylleibid, which is\xa0\xa0 often considered to be a transitional structure\xa0 between syconoid and leuconoid conditions,\xa0\xa0 and the solenoid, which is characterized\xa0 by complex tubes lined with choanocytes.\xa0\xa0 We should point out that the tiny black things\xa0 lining the inside of the sponge are choanocytes.\xa0 In terms of taxonomy, the four extant classes\xa0 of sponges: are Demospongia, Calcarea,\xa0\xa0 Hexactinellida, and Homoscleromorpha. The\xa0 Demospongiae are the most common and diverse class\xa0\xa0 by far, with over 8,800 identified species, making\xa0 up 76% of all sponge species. They are soft-bodied\xa0\xa0 leuconoid sponges with a hard, sometimes massive\xa0 skeleton made of spicules composed of silica.\xa0\xa0 Some species of demospongia can live for hundreds\xa0 or even thousands of years and grow to enormous\xa0\xa0 sizes. The Calcarea, or calcareous sponges,\xa0 include species from all of the three main\xa0\xa0 body structures, including the solenoid.

ERROR:root:orig input: ' A bit earlier in the series we talked\xa0 about the origin of multicellular life.\xa0\xa0 We discussed choanoflagellates and sponges,\xa0\xa0 noting that these represent the emergence\xa0 of animal life around 600 million years ago.\xa0\xa0 Since organisms resembling modern sponges are\xa0 likely the ancestors of all the animals on Earth,\xa0\xa0 it is with such organisms that we will\xa0 begin our exploration of the animal kingdom.\xa0 Sponges are members of phylum Porifera. The name\xa0 “Porifera” means “pore bearer,” which is very\xa0\xa0 fitting for sponges since they’re full of pores,\xa0 or ostia. Tiny little holes cover their bodies.\xa0\xa0 But this isn’t the only unique aspect of sponges. Not only are sponges almost all asymmetrical, with\xa0\xa0 just a few exhibiting radial symmetry, but their\xa0 cells do not organize into tissues or organs. They\xa0\xa0 don’t even have a mouth or anus, so there is no\xa0 digestive tract. Instead, their unique body shapes\xa0\xa0 are adapted to allow for maximal efficiency of\xa0 water flow through their central cavity, where the\xa0\xa0 water deposits nutrients and then leaves through\xa0 a hole on their top end called the osculum,\xa0\xa0 meaning “little mouth.” Some species might\xa0 have several oscula, though most have just one.\xa0 The bodies of sponges are made of two thin layers\xa0 of cells with a jelly-like mesohyl sandwiched\xa0\xa0 between them, which is primarily composed of\xa0 collagen. The outer layer of a sponge is covered\xa0\xa0 in a single-layer of external “skin” composed\xa0 of flat plate-like cells called pinacocytes.\xa0\xa0 Pinacocytes at the base of the animal also anchor\xa0 it to its substrate, the thing it is stuck to,\xa0\xa0 while those that form its “skin” can serve not\xa0 only to protect it, but also to digest organic\xa0\xa0 material. However, the cells most responsible for\xa0 feeding are choanocytes. These are cylindrical\xa0\xa0 cells with a single flagellum. It is the whip-like\xa0 motion of these flagella that are responsible\xa0\xa0 for creating a current to drive water through a\xa0 sponge’s body. So an important thing to understand\xa0\xa0 is that sponges don’t “suck in” water, instead\xa0 their insides are lined with tiny flagella-bearing\xa0\xa0 choanocytes that literally create a current around\xa0 them. This current isn’t strong enough to bring in\xa0\xa0 large animals, but tiny living creatures and\xa0 organic material are easily swept into it.\xa0 So, the flagella whip back and forth causing a\xa0 current around the sponge. The water around the\xa0\xa0 sponge is drawn into its pores, which are lined\xa0 and controlled by porocytes that create closable\xa0\xa0 valves. In addition, there are other cells\xa0 found within the mesohyl, like the sclerocytes,\xa0\xa0 or spongocytes in the demosponges, which excrete\xa0 spicules, the structural element of sponges\xa0\xa0 that also deter predators. Many sponges can shed\xa0 their spicules, forming a dense carpet of spines\xa0\xa0 around them. Other species produce toxins that\xa0 prevent other sessile organisms, such as bryozoans\xa0\xa0 or sea squirts, from growing on or near them. Many species of sponge also have a variety of\xa0\xa0 other cells that move through their mesohyl.\xa0 They have oocytes and spermatocytes,\xa0\xa0 which are the reproductive cells, grey cells,\xa0 which act like immune cells in other animals,\xa0\xa0 amoebocytes, which are amoeba-like totipotent\xa0 cells that can transform into any other type\xa0\xa0 of cell, and others like myocytes, which\xa0 conduct signals and allow parts of the\xa0\xa0 animal to contract, as well as several types of\xa0 collagen-producing cells. Many of these cells,\xa0\xa0 excluding the sclerocytes, can actually\xa0 move and drift freely in the sponge mesohyl.\xa0\xa0 If you look closely at some of these cells, they\xa0 look and behave almost like individual protozoa,\xa0\xa0 which supports what we learned about the emergence\xa0 of multicellular life in an earlier tutorial.\xa0 Now, something fascinating about sponges is\xa0 that since they lack any true digestive system,\xa0\xa0 almost every one of their\xa0 cells consumes organic matter.\xa0\xa0 So as water is flowing into their bodies, any\xa0 tiny organic material such as phytoplankton and\xa0\xa0 detritus that is trapped by a part of the sponge\xa0 is consumed. This is a type of “filter feeding”\xa0\xa0 since the sponges only consume organic material\xa0 suspended in the water column. However,\xa0\xa0 there are sponges, like the ping-pong\xa0 tree sponge, that are carnivorous.\xa0\xa0 This uses tiny, hooked spicules to capture\xa0 small crustaceans and slowly digest them alive.\xa0 This carnivorous behavior is fascinating for\xa0 sponges since as adults, these organisms are\xa0\xa0 sessile, meaning they anchor themselves to a\xa0 substrate and grow from there. Some sponges\xa0\xa0 have taken this behavior to the next level, and\xa0 actually house photosynthesizing endosymbionts\xa0\xa0 within their bodies. These few species produce\xa0 more food and oxygen than they consume,\xa0\xa0 like plants. But remember, they’re still\xa0 animals. Their bodies capture the endosymbionts,\xa0\xa0 they can’t grow them on their own. Also, they,\xa0 like all species of sponge, are mobile as larvae.\xa0 Speaking of larvae, or baby sponges,\xa0 let’s talk about sponge reproduction.\xa0\xa0 The most common form of reproduction in sponges is\xa0 sexual. They release sperm cells into the water.\xa0\xa0 In some species, ova, or eggs,\xa0 are also released into the water,\xa0\xa0 while in others they are held within the bodies\xa0 of the sponge, hoping to be fertilized by a sperm\xa0\xa0 cell from a different organism belonging to the\xa0 same species. It’s important to note that while\xa0\xa0 most sponges are hermaphrodites, that is, they are\xa0 male and female at the same time, they don’t have\xa0\xa0 gonads, or reproductive organs. Sperm and\xa0 eggs are instead produced by individual cells.\xa0 Once an egg cell is fertilized it develops into a\xa0 zygote and then into one of four types of larvae.\xa0\xa0 All of them are basically tiny cell balls with\xa0 flagella that line their epidermis. These larvae\xa0\xa0 will then swim for a few days. Fascinatingly,\xa0 many of these larval sponges possess “pigment\xa0\xa0 ring eyes” that are sensitive to light, and can\xa0 mediate their locomotion. Eventually though,\xa0\xa0 they will sink in the water column and then\xa0 crawl until they find a place to settle.\xa0\xa0 From there they will slowly grow into adults. Many sponge species can also asexually reproduce\xa0\xa0 using one of three different methods, those\xa0 being budding, fragmentation, and gemmules.\xa0\xa0 Contrary to popular belief, only a few species\xa0 of sponges can reproduce asexually by budding,\xa0\xa0 where a new sponge develops from an outgrowth, or\xa0 bud, on the parent sponge, which then drops off.\xa0 Fragmentation, however, is a bit more common.\xa0 All known living sponges can remold their bodies.\xa0\xa0 Fragmentation is when a sponge regenerates\xa0 from fragments that are broken off,\xa0\xa0 although this only works if the fragments include\xa0 the right types of cells, like the totipotent\xa0\xa0 amoebocytes. It’s true that some sponges can\xa0 completely regenerate from a single cell,\xa0\xa0 but it must be the right cell. Not all sponge\xa0 cells, and not all sponge species can do this.\xa0 The third method of asexual reproduction\xa0 is through gemmules. When environmental\xa0\xa0 conditions become less hospitable to\xa0 the sponges, like if temperatures drop,\xa0\xa0 many freshwater species and a few marine\xa0 ones produce gemmules, which are like tiny\xa0\xa0 survival pods of unspecialized cells that\xa0 can remain dormant until conditions improve.\xa0\xa0 Then they either form completely new sponges or\xa0 recolonize the skeletons of their dead parents.\xa0 To finish up, let’s go over the most common body\xa0 structures, also known as aquiferous systems\xa0\xa0 of sponges, and their extant taxonomic classes.\xa0 There are three main sponge structures. First, the\xa0\xa0 simple tube or vase shape lined with choanocytes\xa0 known as asconoid. Second, the syconoid,\xa0\xa0 or pleated body wall, that has inner pockets\xa0 lined with choanocytes, which connect to the outer\xa0\xa0 pockets. And third, the complex leuconoid pattern,\xa0 with mesohyl that contains a network of chambers\xa0\xa0 lined with choanocytes, connected to each other\xa0 and to the water intakes and outlet by tubes. This\xa0\xa0 third body type is actually the most common. Less\xa0 common body structures are the sylleibid, which is\xa0\xa0 often considered to be a transitional structure\xa0 between syconoid and leuconoid conditions,\xa0\xa0 and the solenoid, which is characterized\xa0 by complex tubes lined with choanocytes.\xa0\xa0 We should point out that the tiny black things\xa0 lining the inside of the sponge are choanocytes.\xa0 In terms of taxonomy, the four extant classes\xa0 of sponges: are Demospongia, Calcarea,\xa0\xa0 Hexactinellida, and Homoscleromorpha. The\xa0 Demospongiae are the most common and diverse class\xa0\xa0 by far, with over 8,800 identified species, making\xa0 up 76% of all sponge species. They are soft-bodied\xa0\xa0 leuconoid sponges with a hard, sometimes massive\xa0 skeleton made of spicules composed of silica.\xa0\xa0 Some species of demospongia can live for hundreds\xa0 or even thousands of years and grow to enormous\xa0\xa0 sizes. The Calcarea, or calcareous sponges,\xa0 include species from all of the three main\xa0\xa0 body structures, including the solenoid. They\xa0 have spicule skeletons made of calcium carbonate\xa0\xa0 and are typically small and drab in color. They\xa0 include about 400 species. The Hexactinellid\xa0\xa0 sponges are all leuconoids that are found in the\xa0 deep sea, and commonly called “glass sponges.”\xa0\xa0 They are unique among the sponges because they\xa0 can rapidly conduct electrical impulses across\xa0\xa0 their bodies.

ERROR:root:payload: 'Profesor Dave aquí, hablemos de animales Células. Ahora sabemos lo básico sobre las células procariotas, pero las células se vuelven mucho más complicadas que esto. Los seres humanos y todos los demás animales están hechos. de células eucariotas, que contienen un número de componentes llamados orgánulos que no son presente en células procariotas, algunas de las cuales se parecen a los organismos individuales en sí mismos. Porque son más complejos, sabemos que las células eucariotas evolucionaron de procariotas Células. La teoría endosimbiótica propone que miles de millones Hace años había muchos tipos diferentes de bacterias flotando, todas las cuales eran unicelulares Algunas de estas especies de bacterias adquiridas funciones únicas, como la capacidad de realizar fotosíntesis, o respirar oxígeno. Se cree que las células huésped más grandes entonces envuelto algunas de estas bacterias más pequeñas, y en lugar de digerirlos, una dependencia mutua surgió, cada uno confiando en el otro para algunos función crucial La celda más pequeña recibió protección, mientras que el más grande cosechó los beneficios de algunos tipo de proceso de producción de energía. Aquí es donde viene el nombre endosimbiótico de. Endo significa adentro, y la simbiosis se refiere a organismos que viven y trabajan juntos. Estas bacterias más pequeñas se volvieron más especializadas. durante millones de años de evolución, y eventualmente se convirtieron en algunos de los orgánulos que encontramos dentro Una sola célula eucariota. Entonces, ¿qué son exactamente estos orgánulos? Para responder eso, primero hagamos la distinción entre células vegetales y células animales. Estos son ejemplos de células eucariotas, pero difieren en los componentes precisos dentro. Primero echemos un vistazo a las células animales, que son del tipo que llevas dentro de ti y yo, ya que los humanos son considerados parte del reino animal. Lo primero que queremos señalar es que mientras que las células procariotas tienen su genética información simplemente flotando en el medio de la célula, las células eucariotas almacenan su genética información dentro de un núcleo. Este núcleo tiene su propia membrana, que a diferencia de la membrana celular es en realidad una doble membrana, y esta envoltura nuclear solo permite cosas dentro o fuera pasando a través de pequeños agujeros llamados poros De esta manera, conserva todo el material genético, o cromatina, separada del citoplasma de la celda. Dentro del núcleo hay un área más pequeña llamada el nucleolo donde se sintetiza el ARN ribosómico, así como las partes de los ribosomas mismos. Las subunidades grandes y pequeñas del ribosoma. se forman, que luego salen del núcleo y ensamblar en el citoplasma. Algunos de estos ribosomas se pueden encontrar flotando alrededor del citosol, pero algunos están atrapados a la superficie del núcleo u otros orgánulos como lapas en un bote. Ribosomas, que están presentes tanto en procariotas y células eucariotas, están hechas de ribosomas ARN y proteínas, y estos a su vez sintetizan todas las proteínas que la célula necesita para realizar Sus diversas funciones. Otros componentes de la célula se unen para formar el sistema de endomembrana. Este es un conjunto de regiones unidas a la membrana, que consiste en la envoltura nuclear, la rugosa y retículo endoplásmico liso, aparato de Golgi, y lisosomas. El retículo endoplásmico rugoso es una red. de membranas que encierran la luz ER, que es lo que hay dentro, que consiste en sacos llamados cisternas Se llama retículo endoplásmico rugoso porque su superficie está salpicada de ribosomas, dándole una apariencia áspera. Estos ribosomas sintetizan polipéptidos que se insertan directamente en la luz ER, donde normalmente están doblados y modificados por enzimas en la membrana ER, y algunas veces fijado con un carbohidrato para producir glicoproteínas. A menudo están destinados a la secreción de la célula, entonces se juntan en una vesícula, que es como una burbuja que brota de la membrana ER y luego se dirige a la membrana celular, liberando así su contenido a lo extracelular espacio. El ER en bruto también sintetiza fosfolípidos que puede ser entregado a otras partes del sistema endomembrana, y toma proteínas sintetizado por los ribosomas que serán proteínas de la membrana celular, las incrusta en su propia membrana, y luego los entrega a través de similares vesículas de transporte El ER en bruto está conectado al ER liso, que es diferente en que no está tachonado con ribosomas También tiene una variedad más amplia de funciones, como síntesis, metabolismo y almacenamiento de iones de calcio para ser utilizados para la señalización. El ER liso produce fosfolípidos y esteroides. como las hormonas sexuales Las enzimas en el ER liso pueden desintoxicar drogas y venenos, al agregar grupos hidroxilo a mejorar la solubilidad en agua y eliminarlos de el cuerpo. El siguiente en el sistema de endomembrana es el Golgi aparato. La mayoría de las vesículas de transporte, como las que van desde la sala de emergencias hasta la membrana celular, deténgase aqui primero. Las cosas dentro de las vesículas, como las proteínas, son modificados y almacenados, y luego enviados a donde necesitan ir. El aparato de Golgi consiste en una serie de pilas, y hay una cara cis, generalmente hacia la sala de emergencias, donde llegan las vesículas, y un trans cara, de donde salen las vesículas. En el medio, las moléculas serán modificadas, con azúcares eliminados o sustituidos, y generalmente preparado para su eventual función. Todo esto se hace por partes como los componentes pasar de una cisterna a la siguiente, ya que cada de estas secciones tiene su propio conjunto de enzimas. Antes de enviar las cosas, se entregan productos etiquetas moleculares como grupos fosfato, que es como una dirección en un correo para apuntar cosas para varias partes de la celular, y algunas vesículas también tienen cierta moléculas en sus superficies que pueden ser reconocidas por orgánulos específicos, lo que ayuda a apuntar suministro de vesículas Otro orgánulo es el lisosoma. Este es un saco que contiene un entorno que es mucho más ácido que el resto de la célula, y contiene enzimas que digieren moléculas grandes a través de la hidrólisis, que es el desglose de Un compuesto debido a la reacción con una molécula de agua. Cuando la comida entra en una célula a través de una vesícula, por un proceso llamado fagocitosis, múltiple Las vesículas se fusionan para formar una vacuola. Entonces, un lisosoma se fusionará con la vacuola y separar los grandes trozos de comida en pedacitos más pequeños. Los lisosomas también pueden digerir los orgánulos dañados. que necesitan ser desmantelados en un proceso llamado autofagia Esto permite que la celda mantenga una funcionalidad óptima. Hay algunos orgánulos que no son parte del sistema de endomembrana, y un elemento crucial uno es la mitocondria. Hay cientos de mitocondrias en la mayoría células eucariotas, y estos son los sitios que llevan a cabo la respiración celular, que genera la mayor parte de la energía que necesita la célula para ocuparse de sus asuntos. La respiración celular ocurre en tres pasos, glucólisis, el ciclo del ácido cítrico y oxidativo fosforilación, y usted puede visitar las tres partes serie en mis tutoriales de bioquímica para más detalles sobre cómo funciona la respiración celular. Más allá de esto, las mitocondrias también tienen dos membranas. La membrana externa es lisa, pero la interna. La membrana forma muchos pliegues llamados crestas. El área entre las dos membranas es la espacio intermembrana, mientras que la parte más interna se llama matriz mitocondrial. La matriz contiene moléculas circulares de ADN. llamado ADN mitocondrial y ribosomas, como así como muchas de las enzimas que llevan a cabo respiración celular, mientras que algunos de estos las enzimas se pueden encontrar en la membrana interna sí mismo. Otro orgánulo que también tiene metabolismo La función es el peroxisoma. Contiene enzimas que realizan oxidación procesos, que producen peróxido de hidrógeno como un subproducto. Estos funcionan con las mitocondrias al descomponerse ácidos grasos en componentes más pequeños que son Listo para la respiración celular. Esos son todos los orgánulos, ¿y qué más? está ahí? Bueno, los componentes celulares son típicamente atado a algo llamado el citoesqueleto. Esta es una red de fibras que se extienden a lo largo el citoplasma de la célula y guarda todo Agradable y organizado. Estas fibras consisten en microtúbulos huecos. hecho de dímeros de tubulina, microfilamentos hechos de dos hebras entrelazadas de actina e intermedio filamentos hechos de queratinas enrolladas. Más allá de la organización, estos también determinan y mantener la forma y la integridad estructural de la celda. A veces, las vesículas utilizan proteínas motoras. para entregar sus contenidos a sus destinos moviéndose a lo largo de los microtúbulos, como ER al aparato de Golgi o desde el Golgi aparato a la membrana celular. Este es un proceso que requiere ATP para funcionar, y dos componentes se mueven secuencialmente el microtúbulo en una acción que parece una Me gusta mucho caminar. En las células animales, los microtúbulos crecen hacia afuera de un centrosoma, que se encuentra cerca del núcleo, y consiste en un par de centriolos, que tienen microtúbulos dispuestos en un anillo, nueve juegos de tres para ser exactos. Ahora que sabemos un poco sobre la estructura y función de cada orgánulo, casi podemos ver la celda como una pequeña fábrica, con cada componente que cumple un propósito específico. La membrana de plasma es como el guardia de seguridad. en la puerta, decidiendo qué puede entrar o salir. Una vez dentro, vemos el citoesqueleto, que es el sistema de vigas que proporciona estructura, y el citoplasma, que es el piso de la fábrica. El núcleo es la oficina central donde el jefe se sienta, dando órdenes de la genética instrucciones. El retículo endoplásmico es el ensamblaje. línea, y los ribosomas son la pequeña fábrica trabajadores, construyendo todas las proteínas de la célula necesidades. El aparato de Golgi es la clasificación y envío. centro, los lisosomas son el mantenimiento y trabajadores de eliminación, mientras que las mitocondrias son el horno o la planta de energía que alimenta Todo el espectáculo. Por supuesto, esto es solo una analogía, ninguno de estos orgánulos tienen alguna sensibilidad, pero ilustra cómo una celda es mucho mayor que la suma de sus partes, un sistema vivo con componentes que cooperan para la supervivencia. Además, después de aprender un poco sobre orgánulos estructura y función, teoría endosimbiótica debería ser bastante convincente. Ahora está claro que los orgánulos cerrados por membrana como el núcleo, el retículo endoplásmico, y Aparato de Golgi, probablemente originado de pliegues profundos en la membrana plasmática, mientras que mitocondrias, así como cloroplastos, que llegaremos al siguiente, debe haber comenzado tan completamente organismos separados, ya que tienen su propio ADN y membranas que son diferentes de La membrana celular. Todas estas estructuras diversas eventualmente llegó a servir como compartimentos para diferentes actividades celulares, que a lo largo de un inmenso lapso de tiempo resultó en cosas tan complejas como las células vegetales y animales en la tierra hoy. Todavía tenemos más que aprender sobre las células, y solo estamos rascando la superficie de su complejidad. Pero ahora hemos pasado de las biomoléculas a células procariotas, a células eucariotas, entonces Aprendamos sobre otro tipo de célula eucariota a continuación.'

ERROR:root:orig input: ' Profesor Dave aquí, hablemos de animales Células. Ahora sabemos lo básico sobre las células procariotas, pero las células se vuelven mucho más complicadas que esto. Los seres humanos y todos los demás animales están hechos. de células eucariotas, que contienen un número de componentes llamados orgánulos que no son presente en células procariotas, algunas de las cuales se parecen a los organismos individuales en sí mismos. Porque son más complejos, sabemos que las células eucariotas evolucionaron de procariotas Células. La teoría endosimbiótica propone que miles de millones Hace años había muchos tipos diferentes de bacterias flotando, todas las cuales eran unicelulares Algunas de estas especies de bacterias adquiridas funciones únicas, como la capacidad de realizar fotosíntesis, o respirar oxígeno. Se cree que las células huésped más grandes entonces envuelto algunas de estas bacterias más pequeñas, y en lugar de digerirlos, una dependencia mutua surgió, cada uno confiando en el otro para algunos función crucial La celda más pequeña recibió protección, mientras que el más grande cosechó los beneficios de algunos tipo de proceso de producción de energía. Aquí es donde viene el nombre endosimbiótico de. Endo significa adentro, y la simbiosis se refiere a organismos que viven y trabajan juntos. Estas bacterias más pequeñas se volvieron más especializadas. durante millones de años de evolución, y eventualmente se convirtieron en algunos de los orgánulos que encontramos dentro Una sola célula eucariota. Entonces, ¿qué son exactamente estos orgánulos? Para responder eso, primero hagamos la distinción entre células vegetales y células animales. Estos son ejemplos de células eucariotas, pero difieren en los componentes precisos dentro. Primero echemos un vistazo a las células animales, que son del tipo que llevas dentro de ti y yo, ya que los humanos son considerados parte del reino animal. Lo primero que queremos señalar es que mientras que las células procariotas tienen su genética información simplemente flotando en el medio de la célula, las células eucariotas almacenan su genética información dentro de un núcleo. Este núcleo tiene su propia membrana, que a diferencia de la membrana celular es en realidad una doble membrana, y esta envoltura nuclear solo permite cosas dentro o fuera pasando a través de pequeños agujeros llamados poros De esta manera, conserva todo el material genético, o cromatina, separada del citoplasma de la celda. Dentro del núcleo hay un área más pequeña llamada el nucleolo donde se sintetiza el ARN ribosómico, así como las partes de los ribosomas mismos. Las subunidades grandes y pequeñas del ribosoma. se forman, que luego salen del núcleo y ensamblar en el citoplasma. Algunos de estos ribosomas se pueden encontrar flotando alrededor del citosol, pero algunos están atrapados a la superficie del núcleo u otros orgánulos como lapas en un bote. Ribosomas, que están presentes tanto en procariotas y células eucariotas, están hechas de ribosomas ARN y proteínas, y estos a su vez sintetizan todas las proteínas que la célula necesita para realizar Sus diversas funciones. Otros componentes de la célula se unen para formar el sistema de endomembrana. Este es un conjunto de regiones unidas a la membrana, que consiste en la envoltura nuclear, la rugosa y retículo endoplásmico liso, aparato de Golgi, y lisosomas. El retículo endoplásmico rugoso es una red. de membranas que encierran la luz ER, que es lo que hay dentro, que consiste en sacos llamados cisternas Se llama retículo endoplásmico rugoso porque su superficie está salpicada de ribosomas, dándole una apariencia áspera. Estos ribosomas sintetizan polipéptidos que se insertan directamente en la luz ER, donde normalmente están doblados y modificados por enzimas en la membrana ER, y algunas veces fijado con un carbohidrato para producir glicoproteínas. A menudo están destinados a la secreción de la célula, entonces se juntan en una vesícula, que es como una burbuja que brota de la membrana ER y luego se dirige a la membrana celular, liberando así su contenido a lo extracelular espacio. El ER en bruto también sintetiza fosfolípidos que puede ser entregado a otras partes del sistema endomembrana, y toma proteínas sintetizado por los ribosomas que serán proteínas de la membrana celular, las incrusta en su propia membrana, y luego los entrega a través de similares vesículas de transporte El ER en bruto está conectado al ER liso, que es diferente en que no está tachonado con ribosomas También tiene una variedad más amplia de funciones, como síntesis, metabolismo y almacenamiento de iones de calcio para ser utilizados para la señalización. El ER liso produce fosfolípidos y esteroides. como las hormonas sexuales Las enzimas en el ER liso pueden desintoxicar drogas y venenos, al agregar grupos hidroxilo a mejorar la solubilidad en agua y eliminarlos de el cuerpo. El siguiente en el sistema de endomembrana es el Golgi aparato. La mayoría de las vesículas de transporte, como las que van desde la sala de emergencias hasta la membrana celular, deténgase aqui primero. Las cosas dentro de las vesículas, como las proteínas, son modificados y almacenados, y luego enviados a donde necesitan ir. El aparato de Golgi consiste en una serie de pilas, y hay una cara cis, generalmente hacia la sala de emergencias, donde llegan las vesículas, y un trans cara, de donde salen las vesículas. En el medio, las moléculas serán modificadas, con azúcares eliminados o sustituidos, y generalmente preparado para su eventual función. Todo esto se hace por partes como los componentes pasar de una cisterna a la siguiente, ya que cada de estas secciones tiene su propio conjunto de enzimas. Antes de enviar las cosas, se entregan productos etiquetas moleculares como grupos fosfato, que es como una dirección en un correo para apuntar cosas para varias partes de la celular, y algunas vesículas también tienen cierta moléculas en sus superficies que pueden ser reconocidas por orgánulos específicos, lo que ayuda a apuntar suministro de vesículas Otro orgánulo es el lisosoma. Este es un saco que contiene un entorno que es mucho más ácido que el resto de la célula, y contiene enzimas que digieren moléculas grandes a través de la hidrólisis, que es el desglose de Un compuesto debido a la reacción con una molécula de agua. Cuando la comida entra en una célula a través de una vesícula, por un proceso llamado fagocitosis, múltiple Las vesículas se fusionan para formar una vacuola. Entonces, un lisosoma se fusionará con la vacuola y separar los grandes trozos de comida en pedacitos más pequeños. Los lisosomas también pueden digerir los orgánulos dañados. que necesitan ser desmantelados en un proceso llamado autofagia Esto permite que la celda mantenga una funcionalidad óptima. Hay algunos orgánulos que no son parte del sistema de endomembrana, y un elemento crucial uno es la mitocondria. Hay cientos de mitocondrias en la mayoría células eucariotas, y estos son los sitios que llevan a cabo la respiración celular, que genera la mayor parte de la energía que necesita la célula para ocuparse de sus asuntos. La respiración celular ocurre en tres pasos, glucólisis, el ciclo del ácido cítrico y oxidativo fosforilación, y usted puede visitar las tres partes serie en mis tutoriales de bioquímica para más detalles sobre cómo funciona la respiración celular. Más allá de esto, las mitocondrias también tienen dos membranas. La membrana externa es lisa, pero la interna. La membrana forma muchos pliegues llamados crestas. El área entre las dos membranas es la espacio intermembrana, mientras que la parte más interna se llama matriz mitocondrial. La matriz contiene moléculas circulares de ADN. llamado ADN mitocondrial y ribosomas, como así como muchas de las enzimas que llevan a cabo respiración celular, mientras que algunos de estos las enzimas se pueden encontrar en la membrana interna sí mismo. Otro orgánulo que también tiene metabolismo La función es el peroxisoma. Contiene enzimas que realizan oxidación procesos, que producen peróxido de hidrógeno como un subproducto. Estos funcionan con las mitocondrias al descomponerse ácidos grasos en componentes más pequeños que son Listo para la respiración celular. Esos son todos los orgánulos, ¿y qué más? está ahí? Bueno, los componentes celulares son típicamente atado a algo llamado el citoesqueleto. Esta es una red de fibras que se extienden a lo largo el citoplasma de la célula y guarda todo Agradable y organizado. Estas fibras consisten en microtúbulos huecos. hecho de dímeros de tubulina, microfilamentos hechos de dos hebras entrelazadas de actina e intermedio filamentos hechos de queratinas enrolladas. Más allá de la organización, estos también determinan y mantener la forma y la integridad estructural de la celda. A veces, las vesículas utilizan proteínas motoras. para entregar sus contenidos a sus destinos moviéndose a lo largo de los microtúbulos, como ER al aparato de Golgi o desde el Golgi aparato a la membrana celular. Este es un proceso que requiere ATP para funcionar, y dos componentes se mueven secuencialmente el microtúbulo en una acción que parece una Me gusta mucho caminar. En las células animales, los microtúbulos crecen hacia afuera de un centrosoma, que se encuentra cerca del núcleo, y consiste en un par de centriolos, que tienen microtúbulos dispuestos en un anillo, nueve juegos de tres para ser exactos. Ahora que sabemos un poco sobre la estructura y función de cada orgánulo, casi podemos ver la celda como una pequeña fábrica, con cada componente que cumple un propósito específico. La membrana de plasma es como el guardia de seguridad. en la puerta, decidiendo qué puede entrar o salir. Una vez dentro, vemos el citoesqueleto, que es el sistema de vigas que proporciona estructura, y el citoplasma, que es el piso de la fábrica.

ERROR:root:payload: 'Profesor Dave aquí, hablemos de animales Células. Ahora sabemos lo básico sobre las células procariotas, pero las células se vuelven mucho más complicadas que esto. Los seres humanos y todos los demás animales están hechos. de células eucariotas, que contienen un número de componentes llamados orgánulos que no son presente en células procariotas, algunas de las cuales se parecen a los organismos individuales en sí mismos. Porque son más complejos, sabemos que las células eucariotas evolucionaron de procariotas Células. La teoría endosimbiótica propone que miles de millones Hace años había muchos tipos diferentes de bacterias flotando, todas las cuales eran unicelulares Algunas de estas especies de bacterias adquiridas funciones únicas, como la capacidad de realizar fotosíntesis, o respirar oxígeno. Se cree que las células huésped más grandes entonces envuelto algunas de estas bacterias más pequeñas, y en lugar de digerirlos, una dependencia mutua surgió, cada uno confiando en el otro para algunos función crucial La celda más pequeña recibió protección, mientras que el más grande cosechó los beneficios de algunos tipo de proceso de producción de energía. Aquí es donde viene el nombre endosimbiótico de. Endo significa adentro, y la simbiosis se refiere a organismos que viven y trabajan juntos. Estas bacterias más pequeñas se volvieron más especializadas. durante millones de años de evolución, y eventualmente se convirtieron en algunos de los orgánulos que encontramos dentro Una sola célula eucariota. Entonces, ¿qué son exactamente estos orgánulos? Para responder eso, primero hagamos la distinción entre células vegetales y células animales. Estos son ejemplos de células eucariotas, pero difieren en los componentes precisos dentro. Primero echemos un vistazo a las células animales, que son del tipo que llevas dentro de ti y yo, ya que los humanos son considerados parte del reino animal. Lo primero que queremos señalar es que mientras que las células procariotas tienen su genética información simplemente flotando en el medio de la célula, las células eucariotas almacenan su genética información dentro de un núcleo. Este núcleo tiene su propia membrana, que a diferencia de la membrana celular es en realidad una doble membrana, y esta envoltura nuclear solo permite cosas dentro o fuera pasando a través de pequeños agujeros llamados poros De esta manera, conserva todo el material genético, o cromatina, separada del citoplasma de la celda. Dentro del núcleo hay un área más pequeña llamada el nucleolo donde se sintetiza el ARN ribosómico, así como las partes de los ribosomas mismos. Las subunidades grandes y pequeñas del ribosoma. se forman, que luego salen del núcleo y ensamblar en el citoplasma. Algunos de estos ribosomas se pueden encontrar flotando alrededor del citosol, pero algunos están atrapados a la superficie del núcleo u otros orgánulos como lapas en un bote. Ribosomas, que están presentes tanto en procariotas y células eucariotas, están hechas de ribosomas ARN y proteínas, y estos a su vez sintetizan todas las proteínas que la célula necesita para realizar Sus diversas funciones. Otros componentes de la célula se unen para formar el sistema de endomembrana. Este es un conjunto de regiones unidas a la membrana, que consiste en la envoltura nuclear, la rugosa y retículo endoplásmico liso, aparato de Golgi, y lisosomas. El retículo endoplásmico rugoso es una red. de membranas que encierran la luz ER, que es lo que hay dentro, que consiste en sacos llamados cisternas Se llama retículo endoplásmico rugoso porque su superficie está salpicada de ribosomas, dándole una apariencia áspera. Estos ribosomas sintetizan polipéptidos que se insertan directamente en la luz ER, donde normalmente están doblados y modificados por enzimas en la membrana ER, y algunas veces fijado con un carbohidrato para producir glicoproteínas. A menudo están destinados a la secreción de la célula, entonces se juntan en una vesícula, que es como una burbuja que brota de la membrana ER y luego se dirige a la membrana celular, liberando así su contenido a lo extracelular espacio. El ER en bruto también sintetiza fosfolípidos que puede ser entregado a otras partes del sistema endomembrana, y toma proteínas sintetizado por los ribosomas que serán proteínas de la membrana celular, las incrusta en su propia membrana, y luego los entrega a través de similares vesículas de transporte El ER en bruto está conectado al ER liso, que es diferente en que no está tachonado con ribosomas También tiene una variedad más amplia de funciones, como síntesis, metabolismo y almacenamiento de iones de calcio para ser utilizados para la señalización. El ER liso produce fosfolípidos y esteroides. como las hormonas sexuales Las enzimas en el ER liso pueden desintoxicar drogas y venenos, al agregar grupos hidroxilo a mejorar la solubilidad en agua y eliminarlos de el cuerpo. El siguiente en el sistema de endomembrana es el Golgi aparato. La mayoría de las vesículas de transporte, como las que van desde la sala de emergencias hasta la membrana celular, deténgase aqui primero. Las cosas dentro de las vesículas, como las proteínas, son modificados y almacenados, y luego enviados a donde necesitan ir. El aparato de Golgi consiste en una serie de pilas, y hay una cara cis, generalmente hacia la sala de emergencias, donde llegan las vesículas, y un trans cara, de donde salen las vesículas. En el medio, las moléculas serán modificadas, con azúcares eliminados o sustituidos, y generalmente preparado para su eventual función. Todo esto se hace por partes como los componentes pasar de una cisterna a la siguiente, ya que cada de estas secciones tiene su propio conjunto de enzimas. Antes de enviar las cosas, se entregan productos etiquetas moleculares como grupos fosfato, que es como una dirección en un correo para apuntar cosas para varias partes de la celular, y algunas vesículas también tienen cierta moléculas en sus superficies que pueden ser reconocidas por orgánulos específicos, lo que ayuda a apuntar suministro de vesículas Otro orgánulo es el lisosoma. Este es un saco que contiene un entorno que es mucho más ácido que el resto de la célula, y contiene enzimas que digieren moléculas grandes a través de la hidrólisis, que es el desglose de Un compuesto debido a la reacción con una molécula de agua. Cuando la comida entra en una célula a través de una vesícula, por un proceso llamado fagocitosis, múltiple Las vesículas se fusionan para formar una vacuola. Entonces, un lisosoma se fusionará con la vacuola y separar los grandes trozos de comida en pedacitos más pequeños. Los lisosomas también pueden digerir los orgánulos dañados. que necesitan ser desmantelados en un proceso llamado autofagia Esto permite que la celda mantenga una funcionalidad óptima. Hay algunos orgánulos que no son parte del sistema de endomembrana, y un elemento crucial uno es la mitocondria. Hay cientos de mitocondrias en la mayoría células eucariotas, y estos son los sitios que llevan a cabo la respiración celular, que genera la mayor parte de la energía que necesita la célula para ocuparse de sus asuntos. La respiración celular ocurre en tres pasos, glucólisis, el ciclo del ácido cítrico y oxidativo fosforilación, y usted puede visitar las tres partes serie en mis tutoriales de bioquímica para más detalles sobre cómo funciona la respiración celular. Más allá de esto, las mitocondrias también tienen dos membranas. La membrana externa es lisa, pero la interna. La membrana forma muchos pliegues llamados crestas. El área entre las dos membranas es la espacio intermembrana, mientras que la parte más interna se llama matriz mitocondrial. La matriz contiene moléculas circulares de ADN. llamado ADN mitocondrial y ribosomas, como así como muchas de las enzimas que llevan a cabo respiración celular, mientras que algunos de estos las enzimas se pueden encontrar en la membrana interna sí mismo. Otro orgánulo que también tiene metabolismo La función es el peroxisoma. Contiene enzimas que realizan oxidación procesos, que producen peróxido de hidrógeno como un subproducto. Estos funcionan con las mitocondrias al descomponerse ácidos grasos en componentes más pequeños que son Listo para la respiración celular. Esos son todos los orgánulos, ¿y qué más? está ahí? Bueno, los componentes celulares son típicamente atado a algo llamado el citoesqueleto. Esta es una red de fibras que se extienden a lo largo el citoplasma de la célula y guarda todo Agradable y organizado. Estas fibras consisten en microtúbulos huecos. hecho de dímeros de tubulina, microfilamentos hechos de dos hebras entrelazadas de actina e intermedio filamentos hechos de queratinas enrolladas. Más allá de la organización, estos también determinan y mantener la forma y la integridad estructural de la celda. A veces, las vesículas utilizan proteínas motoras. para entregar sus contenidos a sus destinos moviéndose a lo largo de los microtúbulos, como ER al aparato de Golgi o desde el Golgi aparato a la membrana celular. Este es un proceso que requiere ATP para funcionar, y dos componentes se mueven secuencialmente el microtúbulo en una acción que parece una Me gusta mucho caminar. En las células animales, los microtúbulos crecen hacia afuera de un centrosoma, que se encuentra cerca del núcleo, y consiste en un par de centriolos, que tienen microtúbulos dispuestos en un anillo, nueve juegos de tres para ser exactos. Ahora que sabemos un poco sobre la estructura y función de cada orgánulo, casi podemos ver la celda como una pequeña fábrica, con cada componente que cumple un propósito específico. La membrana de plasma es como el guardia de seguridad. en la puerta, decidiendo qué puede entrar o salir. Una vez dentro, vemos el citoesqueleto, que es el sistema de vigas que proporciona estructura, y el citoplasma, que es el piso de la fábrica. El núcleo es la oficina central donde el jefe se sienta, dando órdenes de la genética instrucciones. El retículo endoplásmico es el ensamblaje. línea, y los ribosomas son la pequeña fábrica trabajadores, construyendo todas las proteínas de la célula necesidades. El aparato de Golgi es la clasificación y envío. centro, los lisosomas son el mantenimiento y trabajadores de eliminación, mientras que las mitocondrias son el horno o la planta de energía que alimenta Todo el espectáculo. Por supuesto, esto es solo una analogía, ninguno de estos orgánulos tienen alguna sensibilidad, pero ilustra cómo una celda es mucho mayor que la suma de sus partes, un sistema vivo con componentes que cooperan para la supervivencia. Además, después de aprender un poco sobre orgánulos estructura y función, teoría endosimbiótica debería ser bastante convincente.

ERROR:root:payload: 'Professor Dave here, let’s talk about animal cells. We now know the basics about prokaryotic cells, but cells get much more complicated than this. Human beings and all other animals are made of eukaryotic cells, which contain a number of components called organelles that are not present in prokaryotic cells, some of which resemble individual organisms unto themselves. Because they are more complex, we know that eukaryotic cells evolved from prokaryotic cells. Endosymbiotic theory proposes that billions of years ago there were many different types of bacteria floating around, all of which were unicellular. Some of these species of bacteria acquired unique functions, like the ability to perform photosynthesis, or breathe oxygen. It is believed that larger host cells then enveloped some of these smaller bacteria, and instead of digesting them, a mutual dependency arose, each relying on the other for some crucial function. The smaller cell received protection, while the larger one reaped the benefits of some kind of energy-producing process. This is where the name endosymbiotic comes from. Endo means inside, and symbiosis refers to organisms living and working together. These smaller bacteria grew more specialized over millions of years of evolution, and eventually became some of the organelles we find within a single eukaryotic cell. So what are these organelles exactly? To answer that, let’s first make the distinction between plant cells and animal cells. These are both examples of eukaryotic cells, but they differ in the precise components within. Let’s first take a look at animal cells, which are the kind inside you and me, since humans are considered part of the animal kingdom. The first thing we want to point out is that while prokaryotic cells have their genetic information just floating in the middle of the cell, eukaryotic cells store their genetic information inside a nucleus. This nucleus has its own membrane, which unlike the cell membrane is actually a double membrane, and this nuclear envelope only lets certain things in or out by passing through tiny holes called pores. In this way, it keeps all the genetic material, or chromatin, separate from the cytoplasm of the cell. Within the nucleus is a smaller area called the nucleolus where ribosomal RNA is synthesized, as well as the parts of the ribosomes themselves. The large and small subunits of the ribosome are formed, which then exit the nucleus and assemble in the cytoplasm. Some of these ribosomes can be found floating around in the cytosol, but some are stuck to the surface of the nucleus or other organelles like barnacles on a boat. Ribosomes, which are present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, are made of ribosomal RNA and proteins, and these in turn synthesize all the proteins the cell needs to perform its various functions. Other components of the cell come together to make up the endomembrane system. This is a set of membrane bound regions, which consists of the nuclear envelope, the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes that enclose the ER lumen, which is the stuff inside, consisting of sacs called cisternae. It’s called the rough endoplasmic reticulum because its surface is studded with ribosomes, giving it a rough appearance. These ribosomes synthesize polypeptides that are inserted directly into the ER lumen, where they are typically folded and modified by enzymes in the ER membrane, and sometimes affixed with a carbohydrate to make glycoproteins. These are often intended for secretion from the cell, so they gather into a vesicle, which is like a bubble that buds from the ER membrane and then makes its way to the cell membrane, thus releasing its contents to the extracellular space. The rough ER also synthesizes phospholipids that can be delivered to other parts of the endomembrane system, and it takes proteins synthesized by the ribosomes that will be cell membrane proteins, embeds them in its own membrane, and then delivers them via similar transport vesicles. The rough ER is connected to the smooth ER, which is different in that it is not studded with ribosomes. It also has a wider variety of functions, like synthesis, metabolism, and storage of calcium ions to be used for signaling. The smooth ER produces phospholipids and steroids like sex hormones. Enzymes in the smooth ER can detoxify drugs and poisons, by adding hydroxyl groups to enhance water solubility and flush them from the body. Next in the endomembrane system is the Golgi apparatus. Most transport vesicles, like the ones going from the ER to the cell membrane, stop off here first. The things inside the vesicles, like proteins, are modified and stored, and later sent to where they need to go. The Golgi apparatus consists of a series of stacks, and there is a cis face, usually facing the ER, where vesicles arrive, and a trans face, where vesicles leave. In between, molecules will be modified, with sugars removed or substituted, and generally prepared for their eventual function. This is all done piecewise as the components move from one cisterna to the next, as each of these sections has its own set of enzymes. Before sending things off, products are given molecular tags like phosphate groups, which is kind of like an address on a piece of mail to target things for various parts of the cell, and some vesicles also have certain molecules on their surfaces that can be recognized by specific organelles, which helps target vesicle delivery. Another organelle is the lysosome. This is a sac containing an environment that is much more acidic than the rest of the cell, and it holds enzymes that digest large molecules via hydrolysis, which is the breakdown of a compound due to reaction with a water molecule. When food enters a cell through a vesicle, by a process called phagocytosis, multiple vesicles fuse to form a vacuole. Then, a lysosome will fuse with the vacuole and break apart the big chunks of food into smaller bits. Lysosomes can also digest damaged organelles that need to be dismantled in a process called autophagy. This allows the cell to maintain optimal functionality. There are a few organelles that are not part of the endomembrane system, and a crucial one is the mitochondrion. There are hundreds of mitochondria in most eukaryotic cells, and these are the sites that carry out cellular respiration, which generates most of the energy the cell needs to go about its business. Cellular respiration occurs in three steps, glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation, and you can visit the three-part series in my biochemistry tutorials for more details on how cellular respiration works. Beyond this, mitochondria also have two membranes. The outer membrane is smooth, but the inner membrane makes many folds called cristae. The area in between the two membranes is the intermembrane space, while the innermost part is called the mitochondrial matrix. The matrix contains circular DNA molecules called mitochondrial DNA, and ribosomes, as well as many of the enzymes that carry out cellular respiration, while some of these enzymes can be found in the inner membrane itself. Another organelle that also has metabolic function is the peroxisome. This contains enzymes that perform oxidative processes, which make hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct. These work with mitochondria by breaking down fatty acids into smaller components that are ready for cellular respiration. That’s all the organelles, so what else is in there? Well the cellular components are typically tethered to something called the cytoskeleton. This is a network of fibers that stretch throughout the cytoplasm of the cell and keep everything nice and organized. These fibers consist of hollow microtubules made of tubulin dimers, microfilaments made of two intertwined strands of actin, and intermediate filaments made of coiled keratins. Beyond organization, these also determine and maintain the shape and structural integrity of the cell. Sometimes vesicles utilize motor proteins to deliver their contents to their destinations by moving along microtubules, like from the ER to the Golgi apparatus or from the Golgi apparatus to the cell membrane. This is a process that requires ATP to power, and two components move sequentially along the microtubule in an action that looks a lot like walking. In animal cells, microtubules grow outwards from a centrosome, which is located near the nucleus, and consists of a pair of centrioles, which have microtubules arranged in a ring, nine sets of three to be exact. Now that we know a bit about the structure and function of each organelle, we can almost view the cell as a tiny factory, with each component serving a specific purpose. The plasma membrane is like the security guard at the gate, deciding what can go in or out. Once inside, we see the cytoskeleton, which is the system of girders that provides structure, and the cytoplasm, which is the factory floor. The nucleus is the central office where the boss sits, giving out orders from the genetic instructions. The endoplasmic reticulum is the assembly line, and the ribosomes are the little factory workers, building all the proteins the cell needs. The Golgi apparatus is the sorting and shipping center, the lysosomes are the maintenance and disposal workers, while the mitochondria are the furnace or power plant that powers the whole show. Of course this is just an analogy, none of these organelles have any sentience, but it illustrates how a cell is much greater than the sum of its parts, a living system with components that cooperate for survival. In addition, after learning a bit about organelle structure and function, endosymbiotic theory should become quite compelling. It is now clear that membrane-enclosed organelles like the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus, probably originated from deep folds in the plasma membrane, whereas mitochondria, as well as chloroplasts, which we will get to next, must have begun as completely separate organisms, since they have their own DNA and membranes that are different from the cell membrane. All of these diverse structures eventually came to serve as compartments for different cellular activities, which over an immense time span resulted in things as complex as the plant and animal cells on earth today. We still have more to learn about cells, and we are just scratching the surface of their complexity. But we’ve now gone from biomolecules, to prokaryotic cells, to eukaryotic cells, so let’s learn about another type of eukaryotic cell next.'

animals are made of eukaryotic cells, which contain a number of components called organelles that are not present in prokaryotic cells, some of which resemble individual organisms unto themselves.","Because they are more complex, we know that eukaryotic cells evolved from prokaryotic cells.","Endosymbiotic theory proposes that billions of years ago there were many different types of bacteria floating around, all of which were unicellular.","Some of many different types of bacteria floating around, all of which were unicellular acquired unique functions, like the ability to perform photosynthesis, or breathe oxygen.","It is believed that larger host cells then enveloped some of these smaller bacteria, and instead of digesting some of these smaller bacteria, a mutual dependency arose, each relying on the other for some crucial function.","The smaller cell received protection, while the larger one reaped the benefits of some kind of energy-producing process.","This is where the name endosymbiotic comes from.","Endo means inside, and symbiosis refers to organisms living and working together.","these smaller bacteria grew more specialized over millions of years of evolution, and eventually became some of the organelles we find within a single eukaryotic cell.","So what are some of the organelles we find within a single eukaryotic cell exactly?","To answer that, let’s first make the distinction between plant cells and animal cells.","plant cells and animal cells are both examples of eukaryotic cells, but plant cells and animal cells differ in the precise components within.","Let’s first take a look at animal cells, which are the kind inside you and me, since humans are considered part of the animal kingdom.","The first thing we want to point out is that while prokaryotic cells have prokaryotic cells's genetic information just floating in the middle of the cell, eukaryotic cells store eukaryotic cells's genetic information inside a nucleus.","a nucleus has a nucleus's own membrane, which unlike the cell membrane is actually a double membrane, and a double membrane only lets certain things in or out by passing through tiny holes called pores.","In this way, a double membrane keeps all the genetic material, or chromatin, separate from the cytoplasm of the cell.","Within the nucleus is a smaller area called the nucleolus where ribosomal RNA is synthesized, as well as the parts of the ribosomes the ribosomes themselves.","The large and small subunits of the ribosome are formed, which then exit the nucleus and assemble in the cytoplasm.","Some of the ribosomes themselves can be found floating around in the cytosol, but some are stuck to the surface of the nucleus or other organelles like barnacles on a boat.","Ribosomes, which are present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, are made of ribosomal RNA and proteins, and ribosomal RNA and proteins in turn synthesize all the proteins the cell needs to perform the cell's various functions.","Other components of the cell come together to make up the endomembrane system.","the endomembrane system is a set of membrane bound regions, which consists of the nuclear envelope, the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes.","The rough endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes that enclose the ER lumen, which is the stuff inside, consisting of sacs called cisternae.","the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum’s called the rough endoplasmic reticulum because the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum's surface is studded with ribosomes, giving the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum a rough appearance.","ribosomes synthesize polypeptides that are inserted directly into the ER lumen, where ribosomes are typically folded and modified by enzymes in the ER membrane, and sometimes affixed with a carbohydrate to make glycoproteins.","glycoproteins are often intended for secretion from the cell, so glycoproteins gather into a vesicle, which is like a bubble that buds from the ER membrane and then makes a vesicle, which is like a bubble that buds from the ER membrane and then makes its way to the cell membrane's way to the cell membrane, thus releasing a vesicle, which is like a bubble that buds from the ER membrane and then makes its way to the cell membrane's contents to the extracellular space.","The rough ER also synthesizes phospholipids that can be delivered to other parts of the endomembrane system, and ER takes proteins synthesized by the ribosomes that will be cell membrane proteins, embeds proteins synthesized by the ribosomes that will be cell membrane proteins in ER's own membrane, and then delivers proteins synthesized by the ribosomes that will be cell membrane proteins via similar transport vesicles.","The rough ER is connected to the smooth ER, which is different in that ER is not studded with ribosomes.","ER also has a wider variety of functions, like synthesis, metabolism, and storage of calcium ions to be used for signaling.","The smooth ER produces phospholipids and steroids like sex hormones.","Enzymes in the smooth ER can detoxify drugs and poisons, by adding hydroxyl groups to enhance water solubility and flush drugs and poisons from the body.","Next in the endomembrane system is the Golgi apparatus.","Most transport vesicles, like the ones going from the ER to the cell membrane, stop off here first.","The things inside the vesicles, like proteins, are modified and stored, and later sent to where The things inside the vesicles, like proteins need to go.","The Golgi apparatus consists of a series of stacks, and there is a cis face, usually facing the ER, where vesicles arrive, and a trans face, where vesicles leave.","In between, molecules will be modified, with sugars removed or substituted, and generally prepared for molecules's eventual function.","This is all done piecewise as the components move from one cisterna to the next, as each of these sections has each of these sections's own set of enzymes.","Before sending things off, products are given molecular tags like phosphate groups, which is kind of like an address on a piece of mail to target things for various parts of the cell, and some vesicles also have certain molecules on some vesicles's surfaces that can be recognized by specific organelles, which helps target vesicle delivery.","Another organelle is the lysosome.","This is a sac containing an environment that is much more acidic than the rest of the cell, and it holds enzymes that digest large molecules via hydrolysis, which is the breakdown of a compound due to reaction with a water molecule.","When food enters a cell through a vesicle, by a process called phagocytosis, multiple vesicles fuse to form a vacuole.","Then, a lysosome will fuse with the vacuole and break apart the big chunks of food into smaller bits.","Lysosomes can also digest damaged organelles that need to be dismantled in a process called autophagy.","This allows the cell to maintain optimal functionality.","There are a few organelles that are not part of the endomembrane system, and a crucial one is the mitochondrion.","There are hundreds of mitochondria in most eukaryotic cells, and hundreds of mitochondria in most eukaryotic cells are the sites that carry out cellular respiration, which generates most of the energy the cell needs to go about the cell's business.","Cellular respiration occurs in three steps, glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation, and you can visit the three-part series in my biochemistry tutorials for more details on how cellular respiration works.","Beyond this, mitochondria also have two membranes.","The outer membrane is smooth, but the inner membrane makes many folds called cristae.","The area in between the two membranes is the intermembrane space, while the innermost part is called the mitochondrial matrix.","The matrix contains circular DNA molecules called mitochondrial DNA, and ribosomes, as well as many of the enzymes that carry out cellular respiration, while some of the enzymes that carry out cellular respiration can be found in the inner membrane The outer membrane.","Another organelle that also has metabolic function is the peroxisome.","the peroxisome contains enzymes that perform oxidative processes, which make hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct.","enzymes that perform oxidative processes, which make hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct work with mitochondria by breaking down fatty acids into smaller components that are ready for cellular respiration.","That’s all the organelles, so what else is in there?","Well the cellular components are typically tethered to something called the cytoskeleton.","something called the cytoskeleton is a network of fibers that stretch throughout the cytoplasm of the cell and keep everything nice and organized.","These fibers consist of hollow microtubules made of tubulin dimers, microfilaments made of two intertwined strands of actin, and intermediate filaments made of coiled keratins.","Beyond organization, these also determine and maintain the shape and structural integrity of the cell.","Sometimes vesicles utilize motor proteins to deliver their contents to their destinations by moving along microtubules, like from the ER to the Golgi apparatus or from the Golgi apparatus to the cell membrane.","This is a process that requires ATP to power, and two components move sequentially along the microtubule in an action that looks a lot like walking.","In animal cells, microtubules grow outwards from a centrosome, which is located near the nucleus, and consists of a pair of centrioles, which have microtubules arranged in a ring, nine sets of three to be exact.","Now that we know a bit about the structure and function of each organelle, we can almost view the cell as a tiny factory, with each component serving a specific purpose.","The plasma membrane is like the security guard at the gate, deciding what can go in or out.","Once inside, we see the cytoskeleton, which is the system of girders that provides structure, and the cytoplasm, which is the factory floor.","The nucleus is the central office where the boss sits, giving out orders from the genetic instructions.","The endoplasmic reticulum is the assembly line, and the ribosomes are the little factory workers, building all the proteins the cell needs.","The Golgi apparatus is the sorting and shipping center, the lysosomes are the maintenance and disposal workers, while the mitochondria are the furnace or power plant that powers the whole show.","Of course this is just an analogy, none of these organelles have any sentience, but it illustrates how a cell is much greater than the sum of its parts, a living system with components that cooperate for survival.","In addition, after learning a bit about organelle structure and function, endosymbiotic theory should become quite compelling.","It is now clear that membrane-enclosed organelles like the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus, probably originated from deep folds in the plasma membrane, whereas mitochondria, as well as chloroplasts, which we will get to next, must have begun as completely separate organisms, since they have their own DNA and membranes that are different from the cell membrane.","All of these diverse structures eventually came to serve as compartments for different cellular activities, which over an immense time span resulted in things as complex as the plant and animal cells on earth today.","We still have more to learn about cells, and we are just scratching the surface of their complexity.","But we’ve now gone from biomolecules, to prokaryotic cells, to eukaryotic cells, so let’s learn about another type of eukaryotic cell next."]]

ERROR:root:payload: 'When the United States started passing comprehensive environmental laws in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a typical law specified how much pollution could be emitted out of a smokestack or a drainpipe. These laws also imposed penalties if pollution limits were exceeded. Other laws required the installation of certain equipment—for example, on automobile tailpipes or on smokestacks—to reduce pollution.\nBoth laws that specify allowable quantities of pollution and laws that detail which pollution-control technologies must be used fall under the category of command-and-control regulation. In effect, command-and-control regulation requires that firms increase their costs by installing anti-pollution equipment; firms are thus required to take the social costs of pollution into account.\nCommand-and-control regulation has been highly successful in protecting and cleaning up the US environment. In 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency was created to oversee all environmental laws. In the same year, the Clean Air Act was enacted to address air pollution. Just two years later, in 1972, Congress passed and the president signed the far-reaching Clean Water Act.

Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the bowled ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching a hit ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket to complete a run. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.'

ERROR:root:payload: 'Hi I’m John Green and this is Crash Course European History. So, leading up to World War I, Germany had promised to back Austria-Hungary in any war, whether offensive or defensive, and armed with this so-called “blank check” of support, the Austro-Hungarian Habsburgs issued an ultimatum to Serbia, which the Habsburgs blamed for the assassination of their Archduke. Serbia accepted the harsh conditions except one--that Austria-Hungary would be allowed to participate in the investigation of the murder. “All reason for war is gone,” German Kaiser William II said. And yet Austria-Hungary and Germany—the Central Powers--both mobilized against Serbia by the end of July, eager to crush the pesky Serbs and believing that the war would be a local and contained one. It didn’t go that way. [Intro] In a swirl of military activity, Austria and Germany mobilized their armies while virtually simultaneously Russia came to the defense of its ally, Serbia. France mobilized to aid its ally Russia. The wild card was Britain, which Germany thought would not come to the aid of Britain’s frequent historical enemy France. And indeed, Britain did not immediately declare war, which was a good thing for the anglophile German Kaiser, who did not want to declare war on his cousin George, King of England, although he didn’t mind declaring war on his cousin Nicholas, czar of Russia. Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice hereditary succession. As discussed in our last episode, Europe was primed for all out war. By this time millions of young men had been trained in the conscription efforts of the past decades. And on the eve of full mobilization, a French nationalist assassinated Jean Jaures, who was a powerful socialist and pacifist working for peace--a potent example of the rise of violent nationalism. Already established plans for military mobilization were rolled out: Russia ordered full mobilization on July 29, 1914, just one day after Kaiser William said “All reason for war is gone.” In point of fact, the German General Staff had also quickly mobilized for war; these things could happen very fast now that military leaders had railroads and automobiles to quickly move troops, supplies, and auxiliary personnel. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble. [[TV-GERMANS IN FRANCE]] 1. Germany declared war on France on August 2, 2. following the Schlieffen Plan. 3. According to the plan, the main German military units would proceed through neutral Belgium 4. and descend through northern France to encircle Paris from the west. 5. Then, after quickly defeating France, 6. troops would be moved to the lightly defended eastern front 7. where the slow-to-mobilize Russian army would be quickly knocked out. 8. The war would be over by Christmas. 9. But the very first stage of that plan involved marching through Belgium unopposed, 10. which did not happen. 11. Indeed, millions of people would die on the western front in Belgium and France. 12. The Central Powers’ plan was complicated when the British joined France and Russia after Germany broke Belgium’s neutrality to get to France, 13. thus forming the so-called “Allied” partners of the war. 14. Also, the Russians mobilized much faster than many expected, 15. moving swiftly to assist their French ally 16. and as a result scored notable early victories against the Germans in East Prussia. 17. However, their generals were less able than their German counterparts 18. and did not follow up on those victories, 19. allowing the Germans to strike back effectively. 20. The Germans regrouped under Generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff, who demanded troops from the western front be brought to the eastern one. Thanks, Thought Bubble So, the war in the east became a nightmare not just for soldiers but also for civilians. Armies moved back and forth across east-central and central Europe, driving out, abusing, and killing civilian populations in the turmoil of conflict. On the western front, conditions were less mobile, settling into a grim pattern of trench warfare in which there was little movement and massive casualties. Because combatants all had access to heavy weaponry, including long-range artillery and machine guns, generals felt that the decisive factor in achieving victory was soldiers’ zeal and confident spirit in battle. They believed flashing sabers and lively marching, along with the “cult of the offensive” would carry their forces to victory. Basically, generals on all sides believed that a vigorous attack, rather than a good defense, would win the war. This meant that on the western front the leadership regularly prepared and executed massive attacks on enemy forces, which were extremely well-defended. During the battles of Verdun and the Somme, literally millions of shells were fired, making for millions of casualties and resulting only in stalemate. Soldiers were ordered out of their trenches to go “over the top” only to be mowed down by intense machine gun fire. Both the battles of the Verdun and Somme were intended as these dramatic and overwhelming efforts to definitively knock out the enemy, and both failed. In the trenches, British soldiers began to sing, “We’re here because we’re here because we’re here because we’re here,” to express their confusion and despair over not knowing why they were fighting or why they were being asked to go over the top. But still the generals ordered more attacks, which led to more casualties and little ground won or lost. The supply of young men to use in this way seemed limitless. The Central Powers benefited when the Ottoman Empire joined its side in October 1914, while Italy joined the Allies in 1915 after being promised major territorial gains upon victory. And combatants also enlisted soldiers from colonies and conscripted hundreds of thousands more to do menial labor. The French, for example, forced some 100,000 southeast Asians into the ranks of soldiers and menial workers, while approximately 1.5 million Indians served Britain, with 74,000 killed in battle. Many people in colonial armies on the western front were put into the very front ranks, meaning they would take the first machine gun fire. More than 2 million Asians and hundreds of thousands of Africans, in addition to Australians and New Zealanders fought on the many battlefields of World War I as the war moved into the Middle East, Africa, and East Asia. And this meant that life within these armies was often very diverse, with people from different villages, and nations, and even continents sharing life in the trenches. By encountering lots of different people, soldiers learned about other ways of living than had reached them in their mostly rural lives. This included many soldiers from colonies, who learned much about their colonizers’ technologies, and also about their barbarism. And some soldiers recreated domestic life in the trenches, observing teatime and attending to healing wounded or sick comrades. Early in the war especially, they also sometimes fraternized with the enemy--in the famous Christmas Truce of 1914, soldiers from both sides on the Western Front left their trenches and met in No Man’s Land, playing soccer, exchanging mementos, and serenading each other. “The Germans don’t want to fight any more than we do,” said one seasoned British soldier. But despite the fraternization, the trenches were largely hellish pits of corpses, filth and excrement. Forced marches passed not over solid roads but over pathways composed of dead bodies. New technology unfolded during the war, which added to the death count. Beginning in 1915 soldiers suffered blinding attacks from mustard, phosgene, chlorine, and other poisonous gases, developed in the rising chemical industry. Airplanes, picked up by the Europeans faster than the Americans, fought one another at close range with guns and began dropping bombs on cities. The fire power wielded by armies was so destructive that journalists were not allowed to photograph battlefield scenes, where mutilated and rotting corpses were strewn for miles and where limbs and other body parts hung, stuck in trees. But artists such as German soldier Otto Dix did seek to capture the soldier’s horror at the battlefield experience. We have a long history of romanticizing war in our culture, but World War I was horrible. The art historian Robert Hughes has written of the peculiarly modernist hell of repetition, and by that measure, and so many others, World War I was hell. Amidst the chaos and brutality of the war, ethnic cleansing flourished across eastern Europe as armies targeted Jews and Poles, to name just two groups. In the Ottoman Empire, Russians and their Armenian allies slaughtered entire Muslim villages, while the Central Powers slaughtered Armenians in a deadly back and forth. And then, in the spring of 1915, the Ottoman government ordered their troops to eradicate Armenians more systematically, leading to the torture and death of an estimated 600,000 to 1 million people. This wasn’t a response to a specific uprising of the Armenians; it was a genocide that deliberately aimed to eliminate as much of the Armenian population as possible. War at sea was also at a deadly stalemate--including the deployment of battleships and submarines on both sides. In 1917, the German general staff resumed submarine attacks on Allied shipping, after having stopped the practice for fear that the United States might enter the war on behalf of the Allied powers. And then that spring, the United States responded by entering the war on behalf of the Allied powers. But their participation was not militarily effective until 1918 because weapons needed to be manufactured and recruits needed to be called up, and trained, and transported to Europe. In the meantime, Europeans were innovating militarily, especially by developing a tactic of concentrated attack at a single point. This puncturing would allow the attacker to move behind enemy lines. But war-weariness was simultaneously bringing civilian uprisings, especially in Russia, mutinies, especially among the French; and even starvation in cities like Vienna. Spanish influenza, a variety of flu that often struck the young and healthy, was also beginning to attack troops. And yet amid all of this collapse, rulers firmly rejected peacemaking or even compromise. In 1915, a group of activist women visited heads of state with a peace plan, which was dismissed--but it did reappear in altered form as U.S. President Wilson’s Fourteen Points. But instead of peace, Kaiser William raged “Only in the ruins of London will I forgive Georgy.” (Georgy being his cousin King George V.) And political leader Georges Clemenceau of France called for a “war to the death.” When Habsburg Emperor Francis Joseph died in November 1916, his subjects were too weakened to mourn. But his successor Emperor Karl did eventually began to seek the war’s end, as did the German Reichstag in the summer of 1917. I know it’s not the time for a joke, but...Emperor Karl? Sometimes, even in the darkest days, history just offers up the most magnificent names All right, back to the war. Even as the politicians began to waver, military leadership remained determined. The Germans tried to puncture Allied lines in a spring 1918 offensive,but victory eluded them as the Allies brought out airplanes and tanks. And then, in the summer of 1918 the Allies, assisted now by American forces, drove the Central Powers eastward toward Germany. Casualties for the six months of German offensives reached two million as their army disintegrated. By January 1918 President Wilson had issued his aforementioned Fourteen Points, a set of principles on which peace should be based. As the war continued taking its grim toll, its end began to look plausible to many in the civilian leadership because Wilson called for a rational settlement rather than a revenge-driven surrender. By the autumn of 1918, not only were soldiers deserting the Central Powers, civilians across Germany were also in rebellion. And so eventually the leadership of Germany negotiated an armistice. On November 9, Kaiser William fled his empire, and on November 11 an armistice was signed. The war was over sorta. In the Habsburg Empire, the various ethnicities were declaring their independence, and Russians were mired in their revolution, which had broken out the previous spring. And the Ottoman Empire was still fighting and would continue to do so as Britain hoped to take over Constantinople with the help of its Greek, American and other allies. So the end of the War to End All Wars did not actually feature an end even to that war. The extent of the loss of human life in World War I is unknowable. But as historians dig into the evidence, it’s clear that deaths were far greater than initially calculated. Only now are historians paying enough attention to the war on the eastern front in large part because the victors wrote the first histories and did the first counting. Wartime deaths, including civilians, are loosely calculated at 40 million people. Joseph Stalin probably never said the line often attributed to him, that the death of one person is a tragedy and the death of a million people is a statistic. But it’s too often true. It’s hard to think of what 40 million deaths means--but here’s one way of trying to conceive of it: More people probably died in World War I than currently live in Canada. Thanks for watching. We’ll see you next time.'

Then, after quickly defeating France, 6. troops would be moved to the lightly defended eastern front 7. where the slow-to-mobilize Russian army would be quickly knocked out. 8. The war would be over by Christmas. 9. But the very first stage of that plan involved marching through Belgium unopposed, 10. which did not happen. 11. Indeed, millions of people would die on the western front in Belgium and France. 12. The Central Powers’ plan was complicated when the British joined France and Russia after Germany broke Belgium’s neutrality to get to France, 13. thus forming the so-called “Allied” partners of the war. 14. Also, the Russians mobilized much faster than many expected, 15. moving swiftly to assist their French ally 16. and as a result scored notable early victories against the Germans in East Prussia. 17. However, their generals were less able than their German counterparts 18. and did not follow up on those victories, 19. allowing the Germans to strike back effectively. 20. The Germans regrouped under Generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff, who demanded troops from the western front be brought to the eastern one. Thanks, Thought Bubble So, the war in the east became a nightmare not just for soldiers but also for civilians. Armies moved back and forth across east-central and central Europe, driving out, abusing, and killing civilian populations in the turmoil of conflict. On the western front, conditions were less mobile, settling into a grim pattern of trench warfare in which there was little movement and massive casualties. Because combatants all had access to heavy weaponry, including long-range artillery and machine guns, generals felt that the decisive factor in achieving victory was soldiers’ zeal and confident spirit in battle. They believed flashing sabers and lively marching, along with the “cult of the offensive” would carry their forces to victory. Basically, generals on all sides believed that a vigorous attack, rather than a good defense, would win the war. This meant that on the western front the leadership regularly prepared and executed massive attacks on enemy forces, which were extremely well-defended. During the battles of Verdun and the Somme, literally millions of shells were fired, making for millions of casualties and resulting only in stalemate. Soldiers were ordered out of their trenches to go “over the top” only to be mowed down by intense machine gun fire. Both the battles of the Verdun and Somme were intended as these dramatic and overwhelming efforts to definitively knock out the enemy, and both failed. In the trenches, British soldiers began to sing, “We’re here because we’re here because we’re here because we’re here,” to express their confusion and despair over not knowing why they were fighting or why they were being asked to go over the top. But still the generals ordered more attacks, which led to more casualties and little ground won or lost. The supply of young men to use in this way seemed limitless. The Central Powers benefited when the Ottoman Empire joined its side in October 1914, while Italy joined the Allies in 1915 after being promised major territorial gains upon victory. And combatants also enlisted soldiers from colonies and conscripted hundreds of thousands more to do menial labor. The French, for example, forced some 100,000 southeast Asians into the ranks of soldiers and menial workers, while approximately 1.5 million Indians served Britain, with 74,000 killed in battle. Many people in colonial armies on the western front were put into the very front ranks, meaning they would take the first machine gun fire. More than 2 million Asians and hundreds of thousands of Africans, in addition to Australians and New Zealanders fought on the many battlefields of World War I as the war moved into the Middle East, Africa, and East Asia. And this meant that life within these armies was often very diverse, with people from different villages, and nations, and even continents sharing life in the trenches. By encountering lots of different people, soldiers learned about other ways of living than had reached them in their mostly rural lives. This included many soldiers from colonies, who learned much about their colonizers’ technologies, and also about their barbarism. And some soldiers recreated domestic life in the trenches, observing teatime and attending to healing wounded or sick comrades. Early in the war especially, they also sometimes fraternized with the enemy--in the famous Christmas Truce of 1914, soldiers from both sides on the Western Front left their trenches and met in No Man’s Land, playing soccer, exchanging mementos, and serenading each other. “The Germans don’t want to fight any more than we do,” said one seasoned British soldier. But despite the fraternization, the trenches were largely hellish pits of corpses, filth and excrement. Forced marches passed not over solid roads but over pathways composed of dead bodies. New technology unfolded during the war, which added to the death count. Beginning in 1915 soldiers suffered blinding attacks from mustard, phosgene, chlorine, and other poisonous gases, developed in the rising chemical industry. Airplanes, picked up by the Europeans faster than the Americans, fought one another at close range with guns and began dropping bombs on cities. The fire power wielded by armies was so destructive that journalists were not allowed to photograph battlefield scenes, where mutilated and rotting corpses were strewn for miles and where limbs and other body parts hung, stuck in trees. But artists such as German soldier Otto Dix did seek to capture the soldier’s horror at the battlefield experience. We have a long history of romanticizing war in our culture, but World War I was horrible. The art historian Robert Hughes has written of the peculiarly modernist hell of repetition, and by that measure, and so many others, World War I was hell. Amidst the chaos and brutality of the war, ethnic cleansing flourished across eastern Europe as armies targeted Jews and Poles, to name just two groups. In the Ottoman Empire, Russians and their Armenian allies slaughtered entire Muslim villages, while the Central Powers slaughtered Armenians in a deadly back and forth. And then, in the spring of 1915, the Ottoman government ordered their troops to eradicate Armenians more systematically, leading to the torture and death of an estimated 600,000 to 1 million people. This wasn’t a response to a specific uprising of the Armenians; it was a genocide that deliberately aimed to eliminate as much of the Armenian population as possible. War at sea was also at a deadly stalemate--including the deployment of battleships and submarines on both sides. In 1917, the German general staff resumed submarine attacks on Allied shipping, after having stopped the practice for fear that the United States might enter the war on behalf of the Allied powers. And then that spring, the United States responded by entering the war on behalf of the Allied powers. But their participation was not militarily effective until 1918 because weapons needed to be manufactured and recruits needed to be called up, and trained, and transported to Europe. In the meantime, Europeans were innovating militarily, especially by developing a tactic of concentrated attack at a single point. This puncturing would allow the attacker to move behind enemy lines. But war-weariness was simultaneously bringing civilian uprisings, especially in Russia, mutinies, especially among the French; and even starvation in cities like Vienna. Spanish influenza, a variety of flu that often struck the young and healthy, was also beginning to attack troops. And yet amid all of this collapse, rulers firmly rejected peacemaking or even compromise. In 1915, a group of activist women visited heads of state with a peace plan, which was dismissed--but it did reappear in altered form as U.S. President Wilson’s Fourteen Points. But instead of peace, Kaiser William raged “Only in the ruins of London will I forgive Georgy.” (Georgy being his cousin King George V.) And political leader Georges Clemenceau of France called for a “war to the death.” When Habsburg Emperor Francis Joseph died in November 1916, his subjects were too weakened to mourn. But his successor Emperor Karl did eventually began to seek the war’s end, as did the German Reichstag in the summer of 1917. I know it’s not the time for a joke, but...Emperor Karl? Sometimes, even in the darkest days, history just offers up the most magnificent names All right, back to the war. Even as the politicians began to waver, military leadership remained determined. The Germans tried to puncture Allied lines in a spring 1918 offensive,but victory eluded them as the Allies brought out airplanes and tanks. And then, in the summer of 1918 the Allies, assisted now by American forces, drove the Central Powers eastward toward Germany. Casualties for the six months of German offensives reached two million as their army disintegrated. By January 1918 President Wilson had issued his aforementioned Fourteen Points, a set of principles on which peace should be based. As the war continued taking its grim toll, its end began to look plausible to many in the civilian leadership because Wilson called for a rational settlement rather than a revenge-driven surrender. By the autumn of 1918, not only were soldiers deserting the Central Powers, civilians across Germany were also in rebellion. And so eventually the leadership of Germany negotiated an armistice. On November 9, Kaiser William fled his empire, and on November 11 an armistice was signed. The war was over sorta. In the Habsburg Empire, the various ethnicities were declaring their independence, and Russians were mired in their revolution, which had broken out the previous spring. And the Ottoman Empire was still fighting and would continue to do so as Britain hoped to take over Constantinople with the help of its Greek, American and other allies. So the end of the War to End All Wars did not actually feature an end even to that war. The extent of the loss of human life in World War I is unknowable. But as historians dig into the evidence, it’s clear that deaths were far greater than initially calculated. Only now are historians paying enough attention to the war on the eastern front in large part because the victors wrote the first histories and did the first counting. Wartime deaths, including civilians, are loosely calculated at 40 million people. Joseph Stalin probably never said the line often attributed to him, that the death of one person is a tragedy and the death of a million people is a statistic. But it’s too often true. It’s hard to think of what 40 million deaths means--but here’s one way of trying to conceive of it: More people probably died in World War I than currently live in Canada. Thanks for watching. We’ll see you next time.'

ERROR:root:payload: 'Hi I’m John Green and this is Crash Course European History. So far, we’ve seen a ton of political change and continuing warfare in the midst of the seventeenth century’s little ice age, and history often focuses on these types of political and military stories, but there were also other changes occurring: shifts in how people perceived the everyday world. The linking of phenomena like earthquakes and eclipses with human events goes back a very long way, like to the beginning of our species, as does the belief that supernatural forces are deeply shaping the lives of individual humans. For instance, in a previous video about witchcraft, we discussed how earthquake tremors in Istanbul in 1648 were seen as portents of a sultan’s death a few months later. But a century after that, a huge earthquake struck Lisbon, Portugal on All Saints’ Day of 1755. Tens of thousands of people died, many from a tsunami that followed the quake. Now, some theologians argued this was punishment from God for the world’s sins, but others pointed out that the earthquake had destroyed a lot of churches while sparing a lot of brothels. Voltaire wrote a famous poem in response to the earthquake that included the memorable lines “As the dying voices call out, will you dare respond to this appalling spectacle of smoking ashes with, “This is the necessary effect of the eternal laws Freely chosen by God?” The way Europeans were looking at the world had changed between the Istanbul earthquake and the Lisbon one: The Enlightenment was thriving. [Intro] So, today we want to emphasize that the Enlightenment wasn’t all high fallutin’ calculations of the sun’s orbit or theories about the mathematical laws of the universe or for that matter theories about earthquake causality. It also considered more down-to-earth situations like how people of different social classes relate to one another, how trade and manufacturing should function, and what the relationship of ordinary people should be to their government. The Enlightenment or Age of Light refers to the belief that the musty old ideas needed to be exposed to rational investigation to see if they were still valuable. The bright light of reason needed to shine on tradition. And this momentous challenge to tradition came about during a time in which Europe was being completely transformed in many ways that are sometimes forgotten amid all the excitement about Voltaire and reason. So let’s go straight to the Thought Bubble today. 1. Beyond the wars and state-building we’ve already seen, 2. increasing abundance and novelty was creeping into the everyday lives of Europeans. 3. Coffee, tea, chocolate, tobacco, and other commodities led to experimentation. 4. For instance, one English housewife saw tea for the first time and thought it was meant to be baked as a kind of pie filling. 5. A diplomat said that tea and coffee had brought a greater “sobriety” and “civility” to everyday life in Europe. 6. Europe had previously been a land of famine and mere subsistence for essentially all of its history. 7. But now the cultivation of new foods from the Americas like potatoes and corn, 8. along with literally thousands of other new plants, meant that available calories were increasing, 9. And it also introduced the idea that maybe the world didn’t have to be perpetually on the brink of starvation and catastrophe. 10. Also, by this time, tens of thousands of Europeans had traveled the world, and had experienced other social orders first hand. 11. For instance, travelers discovered that people across Asia didn’t seem as quarrelsome as Europeans. 12. Drivers of carts did not block narrow streets for hours arguing over who had the right of way. 13. They politely agreed to let one or the other pass. 14. They also saw that not all social orders were as hierarchical as most European ones, 15. and that some societies even gave less weight to a person’s parentage 16. and more to that person’s individual skills and talents. Thanks Thought Bubble. [[TV-Montesquieu]] One of the first ways writers criticized outmoded ways of life was to make fun of them...writers like Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu, aka Just Montesquieu. (He really was the person to criticize outmoded ways of life because, boy did he have an outmoded name.) Montesquieu was a jurist who owned an estate near Bordeaux, which still makes wine under his name, and in 1721, he published the Persian Letters in which Uzbek visitors find Europe amusing if not shocking. The visitors, for instance, are amazed at the magic of priests who somehow perform the trick of turning wine into blood. And although they clearly see the problems in French society, they firmly adhere to the mustiness of their own ways, such as keeping women secluded in a harem and guarded by eunuchs. The message was that both easterners and Europeans were imperfect. The author Voltaire--who, slightly off topic, was very handsome. I mean, very striking eyes. At any rate, he had similarly critical and amusing takes; his discourtesy to aristocrats eventually got him sent to the Bastille prison, in fact. In many rollicking tales, he made fun of overweening rulers and their endless corruptions. He valued honesty and those who lived simple lives “cultivating their gardens,” as he famously put it in his satirical novel Candide (1759), which you can learn more about in Crash Course Literature. Full of horrors and injustice, Candide appeared four years after the Lisbon earthquake, which Voltaire thought was firm evidence that we did not live in the best of all possible worlds. To replace the old stuffy ways of monarchs and aristocrats, people needed to learn how to embrace the newly-desirable traits of the Enlightenment, like being honest, and inquisitive, and open. Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau had many ideas about education reform, for instance. He was not a wealthy or titled person but rather was born into a watchmaking family and lived among artisans. His best-selling novel Emile (1762) describes a boy who grows up not in a city or palace but in a countryside where one can be oneself—a natural individual. Instead of experiencing common rote learning, with large doses of religious and classical reading, Emile learns carpentry, and gardening, and other practical skills. In the countryside he behaves in the best possible way—naturally and without pretentious airs. Rousseau promoted what would come to be called middle-class values, like hard work, practicality, and domesticity for women. When Emile becomes a young man, the spouse chosen for him is plump and smiling and devoted to taking care of him—not studying or reading or practicing a craft or working hard to support the family like farm women did. Also, she will breast feed their children, whereas both aristocratic women and busy working women at the time commonly used wet nurses. As with Emile’s upbringing, all of this is presented as “natural.” Meanwhile, wealthy women in Europe instituted the Enlightenment salon: regular get-togethers in their homes to hear the latest idea, learn about the latest book, or meet the latest philosopher-influencer—called a philosophe in French. Slightly off topic, but I just love the idea of Rousseau and Voltaire as influencers. Like, I would have loved to see their instagram feeds. Voltaire’s smoldering selfies, Rousseau’s weird rants written in the notes app and then screenshotted. It would have been gold. At any rate, 18th Century Salon goers were often great readers or experimenters with the latest commodities and fashion. Just like contemporary influencers, actually. And in terms of fashion, instead of looking to the courts for fashion inspiration, men like Voltaire now sported cottons from India made into handkerchiefs that were worn around the neck, which would soon metamorphose into the necktie). They also sported banyans—that is loose bathrobe type garments—that did not need corsets, which men traditionally wore. As Rousseau believed, men should take off their make-up, wigs, and high heels and be natural—just like people did in other parts of the world. Just natural man as he is naturally made in the countryside, wearing a Banyan and a feathered hat. Transformation was in the air for everyone, not just the elites. Although imported foreign cottons were still illegal in France, for instance, many people now wore them, including servants, who received cast-off cotton dresses or shirts that were bright and easy to keep clean. And to help people learn, there were many more texts. Like in France, there was the Encyclopedie (you’ll notice my amazing French pronunciation). It provided discussions of topics such as natural rights and the status of women. Its main editor Denis Diderot wrote: “All things must be examined, debated, investigated without exception and without regard for anyone’s feelings.”[1] Diderot favored social and political reform. But the Encyclopedie--you know what, I’m gonna just translate it--Encyclopedia, also contained technical drawings of machinery, including machinery for mining. And that reflected practical values and also provided a spur to inventiveness and growing prosperity in Europe. Also, mining, which was already pretty important, was about to become EXTREMELY important, thanks to coal. In general, Enlightenment aims were more worldly than spiritual. In Scotland, philosopher David Hume promoted reason above religion, concluding that belief in God was mere superstition. Some people, called Deists, argued that God existed but that he didn’t influence everyday life after having set the machine of the universe in motion. Many important “founding fathers” of the United States were deists, and if you believe, as many philosphers did, that God keeps a distance from human affairs, then the persecution of people for their religious beliefs starts to seem like cruel fanaticism. And some philosophes became activists. Like, Voltaire was outraged by the torture of Jean Calas, who had been accused of murdering his son to prevent him from converting to Catholicism. (Calas’s son had in fact committed suicide due to gambling debts.) Calas was waterboarded and had every bone in his body broken before eventually dying under torture. Is there a bone back there? All right, listen. This is a femur. I don’t think this is an actual femur, I think it’s, like a recrea--Stan is this a real femur? It is NOT a real femur. So I asked our brilliant writer Bonnie if Calas really had every bone in his body broken and she repsonded, “It’s hard to know whether they got every one,” and then she described Calas’s torture to me with a level of detail that led me to conclude that ONE they probably did break every bone in his body, and TWO oh my god torture in 18th century Europe was THE WORST. So, last thing I’m going to say about this: if you invent a time machine, and I believe absolutely that you can, do not go back in time before like, maybe 2003? Don’t get me wrong--things are bad, but remember: they used to be so much worse. Speaking of terrible, let’s talk about slavery. So, Enlightenment views also fed into rising movements in Britain, France, the Netherlands, and their colonies to abolish slavery. By this time, the slave trade was massive and there was growing acknowledgement of its cruelt. In 1770, the French Catholic abbé (or, clergyman) Guillaume Raynal laid out the violent devastation of native peoples by invading Europeans. And in 1788 the freed slave Olaudah Equiano described the middle passage after he had been kidnapped in present-day Nigeria and enslaved. Now Equiano is often believed to have been born in South Carolina, and his riveting memoir may have been cobbled together from the harrowing tales of others. Still, it was a bestseller. It captured the inhumanity of whites towards blacks, advocated Enlightenment freedom and human rights for all. It also stirred freedmen and slaves to struggle for abolition. And there was also growing movements for other kinds of freedom. The Scotsman Adam Smith took on the mercantilist theory that global wealth was static and states could only increase wealth by taking it from others when he rejected ideas about stockpiling gold, and refusing entry of goods into one’s country, and also remaining a subsistence agricultural economy with serfs. He advocated for manufacturing, the division of labor, and free trade. In a free or laissez-faire market, an individual would work and interact with others in the economy on the basis of their self-interest. And the sum of all self-interests would make for a balanced, harmonious, and prosperous society. Smith is best known as the father of the free market, free trade, and individualism thanks to his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations. But he also opposed absolutism and urged concern for the overall well-being of society. In addition to the benefits of laissez-faire that he saw, Smith saw the potential harms, so he also argued for healing social policies. Another important Enlightenment book was Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s The Social Contract, which famously begins “Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains.” Rousseau picked up on John Locke’s theme of the contract that individuals made with one another to form a state or nation. And he believed that Once freely formed, the state embodied the best that was in the collective community; thus individuals needed to give the state unconditional obedience because it represented the “general will.” Today, thinkers see that this call for obedience to the general will planted the seeds of dictatorial governments in the twentieth century and beyond. But, Rousseau did also emphasize individual sentiments as valuable. At the opposite end of Rousseau’s “general will” was German philosopher Emmanuel Kant’s attention to individual reason. He famously exclaimed, “Dare to Know” as he advanced the Enlightenment’s commitment to the human mind and the ability of every person to think for themselves instead of simply obeying old commands and ideas. The human mind, he argued, housed “categories of understanding” with which information interacted to produce purely rational judgments. And in this way, Kant shared the faith in the individual of both Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith, and we can trace our own culture’s individualism back to the Enlightenment. And many other individuals took refuge in Enlightenment thought as well as taking it as a call to action. Upper-class Jewish women across Europe found the world of ideas so inspiring that they began salons, too. In Berlin, they established nine of the fourteen salons in the city. And philosopher and author Moses Mendelssohn used the more tolerant atmosphere to express his optimism about the future of Jews in Europe. Because of the Enlightenment emphasis on reason, he believed that the age-old persecution of Jews would soon end. Of course, we now know that that wasn’t the case. And much exploitation and oppression has taken place in the guise of reasoned thought. Pseudoscientific “reason” has been used to justify many forms of structural inequality, from racism to sexism to class systems. Rationality would not prove to be a way out of the human urge to create and marginalize outsiders. But Enlightenment thought was nonetheless transformative, and seeking worldly explanations for inequality and injustice did have significant real-world consequences. I mean, no longer would we see Earthquakes merely as acts of God. Enlightenment challenges to the idea that we already were living in the best of all possible worlds would help us to imagine, and eventually live in, better worlds--albeit ones that are still profoundly imperfect. Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next time. ________________ [1] Quoted in Lynn Hunt et al., The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures, 6th ed. (Boston: Bedford St. Martins, 2019) 616.'

In a free or laissez-faire market, an individual would work and interact with others in the economy on the basis of their self-interest. And the sum of all self-interests would make for a balanced, harmonious, and prosperous society. Smith is best known as the father of the free market, free trade, and individualism thanks to his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations. But he also opposed absolutism and urged concern for the overall well-being of society. In addition to the benefits of laissez-faire that he saw, Smith saw the potential harms, so he also argued for healing social policies. Another important Enlightenment book was Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s The Social Contract, which famously begins “Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains.” Rousseau picked up on John Locke’s theme of the contract that individuals made with one another to form a state or nation. And he believed that Once freely formed, the state embodied the best that was in the collective community; thus individuals needed to give the state unconditional obedience because it represented the “general will.” Today, thinkers see that this call for obedience to the general will planted the seeds of dictatorial governments in the twentieth century and beyond. But, Rousseau did also emphasize individual sentiments as valuable. At the opposite end of Rousseau’s “general will” was German philosopher Emmanuel Kant’s attention to individual reason. He famously exclaimed, “Dare to Know” as he advanced the Enlightenment’s commitment to the human mind and the ability of every person to think for themselves instead of simply obeying old commands and ideas. The human mind, he argued, housed “categories of understanding” with which information interacted to produce purely rational judgments. And in this way, Kant shared the faith in the individual of both Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith, and we can trace our own culture’s individualism back to the Enlightenment. And many other individuals took refuge in Enlightenment thought as well as taking it as a call to action. Upper-class Jewish women across Europe found the world of ideas so inspiring that they began salons, too. In Berlin, they established nine of the fourteen salons in the city. And philosopher and author Moses Mendelssohn used the more tolerant atmosphere to express his optimism about the future of Jews in Europe. Because of the Enlightenment emphasis on reason, he believed that the age-old persecution of Jews would soon end. Of course, we now know that that wasn’t the case. And much exploitation and oppression has taken place in the guise of reasoned thought. Pseudoscientific “reason” has been used to justify many forms of structural inequality, from racism to sexism to class systems. Rationality would not prove to be a way out of the human urge to create and marginalize outsiders. But Enlightenment thought was nonetheless transformative, and seeking worldly explanations for inequality and injustice did have significant real-world consequences. I mean, no longer would we see Earthquakes merely as acts of God. Enlightenment challenges to the idea that we already were living in the best of all possible worlds would help us to imagine, and eventually live in, better worlds--albeit ones that are still profoundly imperfect. Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next time. ________________ [1] Quoted in Lynn Hunt et al., The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures, 6th ed. (Boston: Bedford St. Martins, 2019) 616.'

ERROR:root:payload: 'Hi I’m John Green and this is Crash Course European History. So last week we discussed the Enlightenment philosophers who challenged the idea that kings and nobles were qualified to be elites simply because of the families into which they were born into. But still, monarchs were also interested in Enlightenment ideals, and also understood they needed to effectively adapt to the Enlightenment, as they had adapted to previous changes in theology and philosophy. For instance, Catherine II (or Catherine “the Great”) of Russia corresponded often and enthusiastically with Voltaire, even though he criticized despotic rule. And she also offered to print Diderot’s Encyclopedia in Russia when France censored it. We use the term “Enlightened Monarchs” to refer to the rulers who supported and applauded Enlightenment thinkers. But were they in fact Enlightened, or did they remain absolutist despots? The answer will surprise you, unless you have even a passing familiarity with despots. [Intro] First let’s review what the philosophes criticized in the practices of rulers and aristocratic leaders. They singled out torture, censorship, and their arrogance and capriciousness. Like, kings and their nobility could have ordinary people thrown into prison for just about any reason—large or small. And in general most of the Enlightenment thinkers believed that nobles, and the system that supported them, were despotic from top to bottom. French theorist Montesquieu, whom we met in the previous episode as the author of the satiric Persian Letters, also published The Spirit of Laws in 1748. In it, he discussed customs and types of government as they were influenced by climate, and topography, and other variables. To him, there was no God-given standard of divine right rule. Instead, Montesquieu focused on three basic types of government: democracies, suitable for very small states; monarchies that ruled mid-sized kingdoms; and despotic states such as empires that were governed with an iron hand. Voltaire and other philosophes elaborated on these theories: and many preferred Britain’s post-Glorious Revolution type of law-based monarchy, where courts and a parliament were separate from the monarch’s power and a Bill of Rights ensured certain protections to citizens. All of this--the enshrining of rights, independent courts, parliamentary representation--meant that power was balanced among multiple institutions. Also, the multiplicity of religions in Britain was seen as another assurance; it prevented a despotic religious institution from gaining control of the government. Now, we’ve seen from examples like Poland-Lithuania that distributed power and diversity of belief sometimes means internal conflict and political gridlock that weakens a state, but in Britain, Enlightenment philosophers saw an example of a state that was strong without being despotic. And in part because they had an example to point to, the Enlightenment philosophers were difficult for those in the upper echelons of government and society to ignore. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble. 1. King Frederick the Great of Prussia was renowned for his love of refinement and his interest in music and design. 2. Like his friend Voltaire, Frederick the Great collected Chinese porcelain. 3. He also wrote an opera about the Aztec emperor Monteczuma, 4. which praised Monteczuma for religious toleration 5. and seemed to agree with Enlightenment activists who fought against religious bigotry and torture. 6. And Frederick also welcomed religious exiles from less tolerant regimes as a way of building the Prussian population 7. —again a policy in line with Enlightenment. He called himself “a servant of the people.” 8. But all that said, Frederick built a massive standing army, 9. increasing the armed forces to 200,000 men from his father’s army of 80,000ish. 10. And he also forced the aristocracy to serve the state, 11. either in the army or in the administration of the kingdom. 12. And while like a good Enlightenment thinker he lightened the burden of serfs working his own estates, 13. he also rewarded loyal aristocrats by increasing their control over the serfs living in their territories, 14. further disenfranchising the most vulnerable of his subjects. 15. These increasingly empowered landed aristocrats, or Junkers to use the German term, that Frederick rewarded 16. were the very type that Voltaire and other philosophes lambasted in their writings for the aristrocrats’ pride and highhandedness. 17. Frederick even blocked talented commoners from achieving high positions in either the bureaucracy or the army, 18. entrenching aristocratic power still further. Thanks, Thought Bubble. At any rate, as a result of the supposedly enlightened Frederick the Great’s policies, men of aristocratic pedigree in Prussia continued to have a major say in politics and the army into World War I and even beyond. And then there was another of Voltaire’s friends, the aforementioned Catherine the Great of Russia. For someone who disliked absolutism, Voltaire sure was pals with a lot of absolutists. As Czar, Catherine sought to create standardized codes of laws and regulations, which had an Enlightenment-ish tinge, but was mostly an attempt to ease the struggle between all the groups that wanted to shape royal policy like how new monarchs were selected. The people who fought over these decisions included clans, factions of the Royal Guard, groups of influential clergy, and cliques among commercial traders and ordinary citizens. So, Catherine summoned representatives from all social groups for their input. And she found that each only thought about bettering their own privileges or lot in life—the serfs seemed to have the most need for help, while merchants wanted the right to own serfs, and the nobility wanted more of everything. Ultimately, Catherine failed in getting representatives to think first and foremost of the needs of the empire as a whole. Now, like other enlightened monarchs, her policies did aim to be rational, but this was especially true when it came to consolidating state power, which of course benefited her office. So one could argue she was also focused on her interests over those of the empire, but, like other enlightened monarchs and like Peter the Great before her, Catherine did emphasize education. She even founded schools for girls, who were generally seen as not needing an education. The empress also created the first Russian dictionary and appointed a woman to head the project. She undertook the building of roads and the fostering of trade to bring economic unity to Russia. But, like some other Enlightened monarchs, Catherine also boosted the importance of the aristocracy and she consolidated their privileges. She professed to want to improve the status of the serf population, again bowing to the philosophes’ humanitarian concerns, while imposing taxes that affected ordinary people the most. Most of these monarchs wanted a more streamlined and efficient royal administration, but not necessarily for philosophical reasons. They benefited from well run armies. and they really benefited from taxes. During this age of ever-improving weaponry and higher costs for larger standing armies, taxes needed to be increased and also collected more efficiently. In other words, governments needed to operate rationally--not according to the whims of fate or individuals, but according to the needs of the state. In 1770, for instance, Habsburg empress Maria Theresa, who despite that portrait was not twin sisters with Catherine the Great, deployed soldiers to renumber the addresses of urban housing and standardize them across culturally diverse groups who didn’t even speak the same language. The soldiers were told to count the empire’s subjects but also to listen to their individual reports on health and well-being. And this self-reporting served to unify the empire’s wide-range of inhabitants by showing that the state cared enough to count them and ask them about their needs--that might seem minor today, but consider being an 18th century peasant who rarely if ever had meaningful contact with the imperial government. Toleration was an Enlightenment ideal that also served to increase the number of useful citizens in an empire. Like when Maria Theresa’s successor Joseph II of Austria announced the emancipation of the Jews in the Habsburg Empire during his administration, he decreed that Jews could not use their own language except in religious services. Which was a way to better integrate them into the imperial workforce, but the decree also said, “there must be an end to the prejudice and contempt which some subjects, particularly the unintelligent, have shown towards the Jewish nation.” The decree also noted the “deplorable” and even “criminal behavior” towards Jews and called for it to end as a way of strengthening the empire.[1] Joseph II, was probably, like, the most actually enlightened of the enlightenment monarchs, also struck at ancient ideas in other ways, like by diminishing the grip of the aristocracy on serfs. He encouraged agricultural experimentation, including the creation of a freer agricultural work force. So, under his reforms, serfs no longer owed personal service to aristocrats, whose lands they worked, and they could even leave an estate to work as an artisan or in trade. “I have made philosophy the lawmaker of my empire,” Joseph claimed, and in some ways that was true.[2] But the aristocracy rebelled, and after Joseph’s death, his brother and successor rolled back these Enlightenment reforms. Around the same time that Joseph was ruling Austria, in the French home of Enlightenment, rulers like Louis the XV were also listening to the voices of change and attempting to follow them. but, you know, without losing power. Then as now, everyone wanted change so long as it did not affect them negatively. So, French rulers tried to reform taxation and streamline government by getting rid of the Parlements, which blocked the monarchy’s attempts at making taxes a bit more equitable. The Parlements registered royal decrees and their members could sell their jobs to the highest bidder. Royal advisors were like, I don’t understand why those funds don’t go to the government and they also questioned whether there needed to be a bunch of people whose job was to register royal decrees. But the members of the Parlement managed to rouse ordinary people with cries of royal tyranny. So the king eventually backed down. Similarly another reforming minister lifted tariffs and regulations on the grain market in the name of free trade. But the flow of food was interrupted which caused a huge outburst from people. Reform might be good in theory, but when actually enacted, reform often upset social stability and clashed with vested interests. Good news for lots of people was still bad news for some people. Then as now. Last but not least were the Spanish, who with their vast empire were especially eager to streamline government and enhance revenue. To this end the royal administration enacted policy changes known as the Bourbon reforms, which made governmental administration more effective, especially when it came to collecting taxes. These reforms also allowed people of Spanish descent born in the colonies to rise a bit higher in the colonial bureaucracy and army, but they were still prevented from reaching the very top echelons, as of course were native people. Also because the royal administration saw the Catholic Church in the colonies as competing for local people’s loyalty and siphoning off funds, the administration outlawed the Jesuits, alleged to be at the head of a corrupt and influential pack of theologians who were trying to get people to be loyal to Jesus instead of the Spanish king. All right, the stained glass window is back, which means it must be time for the conclusion. Enlightenment thought, which was rich and wide-ranging in possibilities for change, wasn’t universally popular, and all these reforms had their detractors. At times, urban people objected as prices rose or as food became scarce because of changes in trade policies. And in cases where aristocrats were losing command over serfs or having to pay additional taxes, like in the Habsburg monarchy, aristocrats often protested Enlightenment reforms. Still, life was on average getting a lot better for aristocrats. As the eighteenth century progressed, more of them lived in outsized splendor that can still impress us today when we visit the many chateaux across Europe that remain from the 17th and 18th centuries. In many cases they had Chinese porcelain, and lots of other luxury goods. They had access to inexpensive labor that provided them with plenty of food, and also the chance to make huge monuments to their luxury and privilege. And despite the massive destruction of twentieth century wars, many of those monuments survive today. But little remains of the rising poverty of the 18th century. that growing poverty occurred alongside growing European know-how and productivity, and the poor saw that the rich were getting richer even as they were often eating bread cut with sawdust. As governments consolidated their administrations and waged an almost unbelievable number of wars, the poor would approach a breaking point. And beginning in France, they would rebel against the aristocracy. Changes were coming that not even wily monarchs could adapt to. Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next time.

To this end the royal administration enacted policy changes known as the Bourbon reforms, which made governmental administration more effective, especially when it came to collecting taxes. These reforms also allowed people of Spanish descent born in the colonies to rise a bit higher in the colonial bureaucracy and army, but they were still prevented from reaching the very top echelons, as of course were native people. Also because the royal administration saw the Catholic Church in the colonies as competing for local people’s loyalty and siphoning off funds, the administration outlawed the Jesuits, alleged to be at the head of a corrupt and influential pack of theologians who were trying to get people to be loyal to Jesus instead of the Spanish king. All right, the stained glass window is back, which means it must be time for the conclusion. Enlightenment thought, which was rich and wide-ranging in possibilities for change, wasn’t universally popular, and all these reforms had their detractors. At times, urban people objected as prices rose or as food became scarce because of changes in trade policies. And in cases where aristocrats were losing command over serfs or having to pay additional taxes, like in the Habsburg monarchy, aristocrats often protested Enlightenment reforms. Still, life was on average getting a lot better for aristocrats. As the eighteenth century progressed, more of them lived in outsized splendor that can still impress us today when we visit the many chateaux across Europe that remain from the 17th and 18th centuries. In many cases they had Chinese porcelain, and lots of other luxury goods. They had access to inexpensive labor that provided them with plenty of food, and also the chance to make huge monuments to their luxury and privilege. And despite the massive destruction of twentieth century wars, many of those monuments survive today. But little remains of the rising poverty of the 18th century. that growing poverty occurred alongside growing European know-how and productivity, and the poor saw that the rich were getting richer even as they were often eating bread cut with sawdust. As governments consolidated their administrations and waged an almost unbelievable number of wars, the poor would approach a breaking point. And beginning in France, they would rebel against the aristocracy. Changes were coming that not even wily monarchs could adapt to. Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next time.

idea that kings and nobles were qualified to be elites simply because of the families into which kings and nobles were born into.","But still, monarchs were also interested in Enlightenment ideals, and also understood monarchs needed to effectively adapt to the Enlightenment, as monarchs had adapted to previous changes in theology and philosophy.","For instance, Catherine II (or Catherine “the Great”) of Russia corresponded often and enthusiastically with Voltaire, even though Voltaire criticized despotic rule.","And Catherine II (or Catherine “the Great”) of Russia also offered to print Diderot’s Encyclopedia in Russia when France censored Diderot’s Encyclopedia.","We use the term “Enlightened Monarchs” to refer to the rulers who supported and applauded Enlightenment thinkers.","But were they in fact Enlightened, or did they remain absolutist despots?","The answer will surprise you, unless you have even a passing familiarity with despots.","[Intro]","First let’s review what the philosophes criticized in the practices of rulers and aristocratic leaders.","They singled out torture, censorship, and their arrogance and capriciousness.","Like, kings and their nobility could have ordinary people thrown into prison for just about any reason—large or small.","And in general most of the Enlightenment thinkers believed that nobles, and the system that supported them, were despotic from top to bottom.","French theorist Montesquieu, whom we met in the previous episode as the author of the satiric Persian Letters, also published The Spirit of Laws in 1748.","In it, he discussed customs and types of government as they were influenced by climate, and topography, and other variables.","To him, there was no God-given standard of divine right rule.","Instead, Montesquieu focused on three basic types of government: democracies, suitable for very small states; monarchies that ruled mid-sized kingdoms; and despotic states such as empires that were governed with an iron hand.","Voltaire and other philosophes elaborated on these theories: and many preferred Britain’s post-Glorious Revolution type of law-based monarchy, where courts and a parliament were separate from the monarch’s power and a Bill of Rights ensured certain protections to citizens.","All of this--the enshrining of rights, independent courts, parliamentary representation--meant that power was balanced among multiple institutions.","Also, the multiplicity of religions in Britain was seen as another assurance; it prevented a despotic religious institution from gaining control of the government.","Now, we’ve seen from examples like Poland-Lithuania that distributed power and diversity of belief sometimes means internal conflict and political gridlock that weakens a state, but in Britain, Enlightenment philosophers saw an example of a state that was strong without being despotic.","And in part because they had an example to point to, the Enlightenment philosophers were difficult for those in the upper echelons of government and society to ignore.","Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.","1.","King Frederick the Great of Prussia was renowned for his love of refinement and his interest in music and design.","2.","Like his friend Voltaire, Frederick the Great collected Chinese porcelain.","3.","He also wrote an opera about the Aztec emperor Monteczuma, 4.","which praised Monteczuma for religious toleration 5. and seemed to agree with Enlightenment activists who fought against religious bigotry and torture.","6.","And Frederick also welcomed religious exiles from less tolerant regimes as a way of building the Prussian population 7.","—again a policy in line with Enlightenment.","He called himself “a servant of the people.”","8.","But all that said, Frederick built a massive standing army, 9. increasing the armed forces to 200,000 men from his father’s army of 80,000ish. 10.","And he also forced the aristocracy to serve the state, 11.","either in the army or in the administration of the kingdom.","12.","And while like a good Enlightenment thinker he lightened the burden of serfs working his own estates, 13.","he also rewarded loyal aristocrats by increasing their control over the serfs living in their territories, 14.","further disenfranchising the most vulnerable of his subjects.","15.","These increasingly empowered landed aristocrats, or Junkers to use the German term, that Frederick rewarded 16.","were the very type that Voltaire and other philosophes lambasted in their writings for the aristrocrats’ pride and highhandedness.","17.","Frederick even blocked talented commoners from achieving high positions in either the bureaucracy or the army, 18.","entrenching aristocratic power still further.","Thanks, Thought Bubble.","At any rate, as a result of the supposedly enlightened Frederick the Great’s policies, men of aristocratic pedigree in Prussia continued to have a major say in politics and the army into World War I and even beyond.","And then there was another of Voltaire’s friends, the aforementioned Catherine the Great of Russia.","For someone who disliked absolutism, Voltaire sure was pals with a lot of absolutists.","As Czar, Catherine sought to create standardized codes of laws and regulations, which had an Enlightenment-ish tinge, but was mostly an attempt to ease the struggle between all the groups that wanted to shape royal policy like how new monarchs were selected.","The people who fought over these decisions included clans, factions of the Royal Guard, groups of influential clergy, and cliques among commercial traders and ordinary citizens.","So, Catherine summoned representatives from all social groups for their input.","And she found that each only thought about bettering their own privileges or lot in life—the serfs seemed to have the most need for help, while merchants wanted the right to own serfs, and the nobility wanted more of everything.","Ultimately, Catherine failed in getting representatives to think first and foremost of the needs of the empire as a whole.","Now, like other enlightened monarchs, her policies did aim to be rational, but this was especially true when it came to consolidating state power, which of course benefited her office.","So one could argue she was also focused on her interests over those of the empire, but, like other enlightened monarchs and like Peter the Great before her, Catherine did emphasize education.","She even founded schools for girls, who were generally seen as not needing an education.","The empress also created the first Russian dictionary and appointed a woman to head the project.","She undertook the building of roads and the fostering of trade to bring economic unity to Russia.","But, like some other Enlightened monarchs, Catherine also boosted the importance of the aristocracy and she consolidated their privileges.","She professed to want to improve the status of the serf population, again bowing to the philosophes’ humanitarian concerns, while imposing taxes that affected ordinary people the most.","Most of these monarchs wanted a more streamlined and efficient royal administration, but not necessarily for philosophical reasons.","They benefited from well run armies.","and they really benefited from taxes.","During this age of ever-improving weaponry and higher costs for larger standing armies, taxes needed to be increased and also collected more efficiently.","In other words, governments needed to operate rationally--not according to the whims of fate or individuals, but according to the needs of the state.","In 1770, for instance, Habsburg empress Maria Theresa, who despite that portrait was not twin sisters with Catherine the Great, deployed soldiers to renumber the addresses of urban housing and standardize them across culturally diverse groups who didn’t even speak the same language.","The soldiers were told to count the empire’s subjects but also to listen to their individual reports on health and well-being.","And this self-reporting served to unify the empire’s wide-range of inhabitants by showing that the state cared enough to count them and ask them about their needs--that might seem minor today, but consider being an 18th century peasant who rarely if ever had meaningful contact with the imperial government.","Toleration was an Enlightenment ideal that also served to increase the number of useful citizens in an empire.","Like when Maria Theresa’s successor Joseph II of Austria announced the emancipation of the Jews in the Habsburg Empire during his administration, he decreed that Jews could not use their own language except in religious services.","Which was a way to better integrate them into the imperial workforce, but the decree also said, “there must be an end to the prejudice and contempt which some subjects, particularly the unintelligent, have shown towards the Jewish nation.”","The decree also noted the “deplorable” and even “criminal behavior” towards Jews and called for it to end as a way of strengthening the empire.[1]","Joseph II, was probably, like, the most actually enlightened of the enlightenment monarchs, also struck at ancient ideas in other ways, like by diminishing the grip of the aristocracy on serfs.","He encouraged agricultural experimentation, including the creation of a freer agricultural work force.","So, under his reforms, serfs no longer owed personal service to aristocrats, whose lands they worked, and they could even leave an estate to work as an artisan or in trade.","“I have made philosophy the lawmaker of my empire,” Joseph claimed, and in some ways that was true.[2]","But the aristocracy rebelled, and after Joseph’s death, his brother and successor rolled back these Enlightenment reforms.","Around the same time that Joseph was ruling Austria, in the French home of Enlightenment, rulers like Louis the XV were also listening to the voices of change and attempting to follow them.","but, you know, without losing power.","Then as now, everyone wanted change so long as it did not affect them negatively.","So, French rulers tried to reform taxation and streamline government by getting rid of the Parlements, which blocked the monarchy’s attempts at making taxes a bit more equitable.","The Parlements registered royal decrees and their members could sell their jobs to the highest bidder.","Royal advisors were like, I don’t understand why those funds don’t go to the government and they also questioned whether there needed to be a bunch of people whose job was to register royal decrees.","But the members of the Parlement managed to rouse ordinary people with cries of royal tyranny.","So the king eventually backed down.","Similarly another reforming minister lifted tariffs and regulations on the grain market in the name of free trade.","But the flow of food was interrupted which caused a huge outburst from people.","Reform might be good in theory, but when actually enacted, reform often upset social stability and clashed with vested interests.","Good news for lots of people was still bad news for some people.","Then as now.","Last but not least were the Spanish, who with their vast empire were especially eager to streamline government and enhance revenue.","To this end the royal administration enacted policy changes known as the Bourbon reforms, which made governmental administration more effective, especially when it came to collecting taxes.","These reforms also allowed people of Spanish descent born in the colonies to rise

ERROR:root:payload: 'Hi, I’m John Green and this is Crash Course US History. Starting next week, we’re going to be talking about the Civil War. As you may have noticed, Crash Course doesn’t usually focus on military history, because we’re more interested in causes and effects and that kind of stuff, but because some in our audience are likely to insist that a series on American History has to include the battles of the Civil War, I am now going to tell you about EVERY SINGLE fight of the war. Oh. Stan, this says there were 8,000 instances of violence between the Union and the Confederate States of America between 1861 and 1865. Can that be right? Slight change of plan. I’m going to tell you about the MAJOR battles of the Civil War. [Theme Music] The shooting started in 1861. In April the first shots of the war were fired at the Battle of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, which the South won. Next the Battle of Rich Mountain went to the North. First Bull Run happened in Manassas, VA in July. The South won, General Jackson got the nickname Stonewall, and the North realized this war was going to be serious business. The South had another victory at Wilson’s Creek in August, but lost to the Union at Carnifex Ferry in September. The North got another win at the Battle of Cheat Mountain, but the South finished the year strong with wins at Ball’s Bluff and Chustenahlah. The North came roaring back in 1862 with wins at the battles of Mill Springs, Fort Henry, Roanoke Island, and Fort Donelson, where the Confederate general was named Simon Bolivar Buckner. What!? There was fighting in the west, with the South winning at Valverder, NM, and Pea Ridge, AR. The Union won at New Madrid, MO. The Battle of Hampton Roads, VA in March was a draw, and featured the first fight between two ironclad warships, the USS Monitor and the CSS Virginia. The Union won the Battle of Bern, and the first battle of Kernstown, and then draws at Glorieta Pass, NM, and Yorktown. The Union won the Battle of Shiloh, where future Ben Hur author Lew Wallace was accused of incompetence and cowardice. The Union also won at the Battle of Fort Pulaski and the Battles of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, which gave the North control of New Orleans. The North then won the Siege of Corinth, and Union general McClellan fought one of the most indecisive battles he would be involved in at Williamsburg, Virginia, which is really saying something, because he was pretty indecisive. Then Stonewall Jackson had a great run, winning battles at McDowell, Front Royal, and Winchester. Union forces captured Memphis, TN in May, but then lost a couple more to Jackson at Cross Keys and Port Republic. In Virginia that June, Robert E. Lee and George McClellan fought a series of six battles in seven days, which were called the seven days battles, because historians are so good at naming things. There was a draw at Oak Grove, Union victory at Beaver Dam Creek, a win for Lee at Gaines\' Mill, ties at Garnett\'s and Golding\'s Farms, The Battle of Savage\'s Stations, and the Battle for Glendale. The Union finally won the Seven Days at Malvern Hill, but McClellan withdrew after the battle, allowing Lee and the remaining confederates to escape. In July 1862, one of the least consequential battles of the war took place in Stan’s hometown, Newburgh, IN. A force of 35 Confederate irregulars built some fake cannons out of stovepipes that they called Quaker guns, crossed the Ohio River, captured some weapons and a hospital full of wounded Union soldiers, and then abandoned the town later the same day. Later that summer came the Battles of Baton Rouge, Cedar Mountain, Mannassas Station, the Second Battle of Bull Run, Richmond, KY, Chantilly, and Harper’s Ferry, all of which the Confederates won. The Union won at South Mountain, but lost at Munfordville. On September 17 McClellan ended Lee’s invasion of the north at Anteitam, MD. This was the bloodiest single day of the war with 22,717 dead, wounded, or missing. The rest of 1862 saw the battles of Perryville, Prairie Grove, Fredericksburg, and Chickasaw Bayou. By the way, if this is starting to sound like baseball box scores, maybe you\'re getting a glimpse of why we don\'t usually do the military history. Right, but back to the Civil War: 1863 started in Tennessee with a Union victory at the Battle of Stones River, but also with a simultaneous Confederate victory at Galveston, TX. There were lots of smallish skirmishes during the winter and early Spring, until the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, where Lee defeated Hooker, but Stonewall Jackson was mortally wounded. Jackson lost his left arm and then Lee said "I have lost my right arm." Jackson then proceeded to famously say "Let us cross over the river and rest under the shade of those trees," and then died 8 days later. His arm, by the way, is buried with its own headstone near Chancellorsville. The North won a bunch of battles in Mississippi at Port Gibson, Raymond, Jackson, Champion Hill, Big Black River Ridge, and finally, Vicksburg. That victory, along with the victory at Port Hudson, effectively ended the Confederates\' ability to use the Mississippi River. Fighting in June 1863 in Virginia was inconclusive with draws in Brandy Station, Aldie and Upperville, and then July brought the Battle of Gettysburg, a major Union victory. This battle featured Pickett\'s famous charge, it was the end of Lee\'s second invasion of the North, it was the costliest battle of the war in terms of casualties and it led to, surprisingly, the Gettysburg Address. The rest of that summer brought split results to Confederate victories at Fort Wagner, South Carolina. They also won at Fort Sumter again, holding the fort against heavy Union bombardment, and they perpetrated a massacre of civilians in Warrens, Kansas. The rest of 1863 saw battles at the Bayou of Force, Arkansas; a major Confederate win at Chickamauga; the battles of Bristoe Station, Wauhatchie, Rappahannock Station, Chattanooga again, Ringgold Gap, Fort Sanders and Mossy Creek. Stan, are you making some of these places up? A creek cannot be mossy. Oh man, we’re only to 1864. Gotta keep it moving. Stan, can you just indicate who won these on screen? Awesome. The spring saw the Battles of Mansfield; Pleasant Hill, Louisiana and Fort Pillow, Tennessee. Then there was the Battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Courthouse, New Market, North Anna, Old Church and the Battle of the Cold Harbor, all in Virginia. Summer brought the battles of Marietta, Georgia and Petersburg were all fought in Virginia as well. And there was Kennesaw Mountain, Georgia; Monocacy, Maryland and Fort Stevens in the District of Columbia. By the way, Abraham Lincoln himself went to observe that battle and the guy standing next to him got shot. Then there were the Battles of Peach Tree Creek, Georgia and Atlanta, Georgia - a major Union victory won by General Sherman. Also fought were the Battles of Ezra Church, Georgia; the Battle of the Crater in Virginia; the Battles of Mobile Bay, Alabama; Deep Bottom Globe Tavern and Jonesboro, Georgia, which solidified Union control of Atlanta. Okay, autumn 1864 we are really in the home stretch. The Battles of Opequon, Fisher\'s Hill, Chaffin\'s Farm and Cedar Creek were all fought in Virginia. Johnsonville, Tennessee; the Sand Creek Massacre; the Battle of Franklin, Tennessee; Fort McAllister, Georgia and Nashville, Tennessee finished out the year. Alright, 1865 here we go: The Battles of Fort Fisher, North Carolina; Hactcher\'s Run, Virginia; Bentonville, North Carolina; Fort Stedman, Virginia; Five Forks, Virginia; the Third Battle of Petersburg, Virginia; Fort Blakely, Alabama; Sailor\'s Creek, Virginia, Appomattox Station, Virginia; and, finally, the decisive battle, at Appomattox Courthouse, Virginia, on April 8th, 1865, which resulted in Lee\'s surrender to Grant - there were a few more minor skirmishes - but the war was over!

ERROR:root:orig input: ' Hi, I’m John Green and this is Crash Course US History. Starting next week, we’re going to be talking about the Civil War. As you may have noticed, Crash Course doesn’t usually focus on military history, because we’re more interested in causes and effects and that kind of stuff, but because some in our audience are likely to insist that a series on American History has to include the battles of the Civil War, I am now going to tell you about EVERY SINGLE fight of the war. Oh. Stan, this says there were 8,000 instances of violence between the Union and the Confederate States of America between 1861 and 1865. Can that be right? Slight change of plan. I’m going to tell you about the MAJOR battles of the Civil War. [Theme Music] The shooting started in 1861. In April the first shots of the war were fired at the Battle of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, which the South won. Next the Battle of Rich Mountain went to the North.

ERROR:root:payload: 'Twinkle, twinkle little star. Oh. I know who you are. At first glance, stars pretty much all look alike. Twinkly dots, scattered across the sky. But as I talked about in episode 2, when you look more closely you see differences. The most obvious is that some look bright and some faint. As I said then, sometimes that’s due to them being at different distances, but it’s also true that stars emit different amounts of light, too. If you look through binoculars or take pictures of them, you’ll see that they’re all different colors, too. Some appear white, some red, orange, blue, and for a long time, the reason for this was a mystery. In the waning years of the 19th century, astrophotography was becoming an important scientific tool. Being able to hook a camera up to a telescope and take long exposures meant being able to see fainter objects, revealing previously hidden details. It also meant that spectroscopy became a force, say it with me now, for science. A spectrum is the result when you divide the incoming light from an object into individual colors, or wavelengths. This reveals a vast amount of physical data about the object. But in the late 1800s, we were only just starting to figure that out. Interpreting stellar spectra was a tough problem. The spectrum we measure from a star is a combination of two different kinds of spectra. Stars are hot, dense balls of gas, so they give off a continuous spectrum; that is, they emit light at all wavelengths. However, stars also have atmospheres, thinner layers of gas above the denser inner layers. These gases absorb light at specific wavelengths from the light below depending on the elements in them. The result is that the continuous spectrum of a star has gaps in it, darker bands where different elements absorb different colors. At first, stars were classified by the strengths of their hydrogen lines. The strongest were called A stars, the next strongest B, then C, and so on. But in 1901, a new system was introduced by spectroscopist Annie Jump Cannon, who dropped or merged a few of the old classifications, and then rearranged them into one that classified stars by the strengths and appearances of many different absorption lines in their spectra. A few years later, physicist Max Planck solved a thorny problem in physics, showing how objects like stars give off light of different colors based on their temperature. Hotter stars put out more light at the blue end of the spectrum, while cooler ones peaked in the red. Around the same time, Bengali physicist Meghnad Saha solved another tough problem: how atoms give off light at different temperatures. Two decades later, the brilliant astronomer Cecelia Payne-Gaposchkin put all these pieces together. She showed that the spectra of stars depended on the temperature and elements in their atmospheres. This unlocked the secrets of the stars, allowing astronomers to understand not just their composition but also many other physical traits. For example, at the time, it was thought that stars had roughly the same composition as the Earth, but Payne-Gaposchkin showed that stars were overwhelmingly composed of hydrogen, with helium as the second most abundant element. The classification scheme proposed by Cannon and decoded by Payne-Gaposchkin is still used today, and arranges stars by their temperature, assigning each a letter. Because they were rearranged from an older system the letters aren’t alphabetical: So the hottest are O-type stars, slightly cooler are B, followed by A, F, G, K, and M. It’s a little weird, but many people use the mnemonic, “Oh Be A Fine Guy, Kiss Me,” or “Oh Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me,” to remember it — which was dreamed up by Annie Jump Cannon herself! Each letter grouping is divided into 10 subgroups, again according to temperature. We’ve also discovered even cooler stars in the past few decades, and these are assigned the letters L, T, and Y. The Sun has a surface temperature of about 5500° Celsius, and is a G2 star. A slightly hotter star would be a G1, and a slightly cooler  star a G3. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, is much hotter than the Sun, and is classified as an A0. Betelgeuse, which is red and cool, is an M2. Stars come in almost every color of the rainbow. Hot stars are blue, cool stars red. In between there are orange and even some yellow stars. But there are no green stars. Look as much as you want, and you won’t find any. It’s because of the way our eyes see color. A star can put out lots of green light, but if it does it’ll also emit red, blue, and orange. And our eyes mix those together to form other colors. A star can actually emit more green light than any other color, but we’ll wind up seeing it as white! How do I know? Because if you look at the sun’s spectrum, it actually peaks in the green! Isn’t that weird? The Sun puts out more green light than any other color, but our eyes see all the mixed colors together as white. Wait, what? White? You may be thinking the Sun is actually yellow. Not really. The light from the Sun is white, but some of the shorter wavelengths like purple and blue and some green get scattered away by molecules of nitrogen in our air. Those appear to be coming from every direction but the Sun, which is why the sky looks blue. The Sun doesn’t emit much purple, so the sky doesn’t look purple, and the green doesn’t scatter as well as blue. That gives the Sun a yellowish tint to our eyes, and looking at the Sun is painful anyway, so it’s hard to accurately gauge what color it appears. That’s also why sunsets look orange or red: You’re looking through more air on the horizon to see the Sun, so all the bluer light is scattered away. So we can use spectra to determine a lot about a star. But if you combine that with knowing a star’s distance, things get amazing. You can measure how bright the star appears to be in your telescope, and by using the distance you can calculate how much energy it’s actually giving off — what astronomers call its luminosity. An intrinsically faint light looks bright if it’s nearby, but so does a very luminous light far away. By knowing the distance, you can correct for that, and figure out how luminous the objects actually are. This was, no exaggeration, the key to understanding stars. A lot of a star’s physical characteristics are related: Its luminosity depends on its size and temperature. If two stars are the same size, but one is hotter, the hotter one will be more luminous. If two stars are the same temperature, but one is bigger, the bigger one will be more luminous. Knowing the temperature and distance means knowing the stars themselves. Still, it’s a lot of data. A century ago, spectra were taken of hundreds of thousands of stars! How do you even start looking at all that? The best way to understand a large group of objects is to look for trends. Is there a relationship between color and distance? How about temperature and size? You compare and contrast them in as many ways possible and see what pops up. I’ll spare you the work. A century ago astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell made a graph, in which they plotted a star’s luminosity versus its temperature. When they did, they got a surprise: a VERY strong trend. This is called an HR Diagram, after Hertzsprung and Russell. It’s not an exaggeration to call it the single most important graph in all of astronomy! In this graph, really bright stars are near the top, fainter ones near the bottom. Hot, blue stars are on the left, and cool, red stars on the right. The groups are pretty obvious! There’s that thick line running diagonally down the middle, the clump to the upper right, and the smaller clump to the lower left.  This took a long time to fully understand, but now we know this diagram is showing us how stars live their lives. Most stars fall into that thick line, and that’s why astronomers call it the Main Sequence. The term is a little misleading; it’s not really a sequence per se, but as usual in astronomy it’s an old term and we got stuck with it. The reason the main sequence is a broad, long line has to do with how stars make energy. Like the Sun, stars generate energy by fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores. A star that fuses hydrogen faster will be hotter, because it’s making more energy. The rate of fusion depends on the pressure in a star’s core. More massive stars can squeeze their cores harder, so they fuse faster and get hotter than low mass stars. It’s pretty much that simple. And that explains the main sequence! Stars spend most of their lives fusing hydrogen into helium, which is why the main sequence has most of the stars on it; those are the ones merrily going about their starry business of making energy. Massive stars are hotter and more luminous, so they fall on the upper left of the main sequence. Stars with lower mass are cooler and redder, so they fall a little lower to the right, and so on. The Sun is there, too, more or less in the middle. What about the other groups? Well, the stars on the lower left are hot, blue-white, but very faint. That means they must be small and we call them white dwarfs. They’re the result of a star like the Sun eventually running out of hydrogen fuel. We’ll get back to them in a future episode. The stars on the upper right are luminous but cool. They must therefore be huge. These are red giants, also part of the dying process of stars like the Sun. Above them are red SUPERgiants, massive stars beginning their death stage. You can see some stars that are also that luminous but at the upper left; those are blue supergiants. They’re more rare, but they too are the end stage for some stars, and again we’ll get to them soon enough in a future episode. But I’ll just say here that it, um, doesn’t end well for them. But, on a brighter note, we literally owe our existence to them. And this implies something very nifty about the HR diagram: Stars can change position on it. Not only that, but massive stars versus low mass stars age differently, and go to different parts of the HR diagram as they die. In many ways, the diagram allows us to tell at a glance just what a star is doing with itself. This difference between the way low mass stars like the Sun and higher mass stars age is actually critical to understanding a lot more about what we see in the sky… so much so that they’ll be handled separately in later episodes. I’m sorry to tease so much about what’s to come, but this aspect of stars — finally understanding them physically — was a MAJOR step in astronomy, leading to understanding so much more. And don’t you worry: we’ll get to all that. Today you learned that stars can be categorized using their spectra. Together with their distance, this provides a wealth of information about them including their luminosity, size, and temperature. The HR diagram plots stars’ luminosity versus temperature, and most stars fall along the main sequence, where they live most of their lives.

star.","Oh.","I know who you are.","At first glance, stars pretty much all look alike.","Twinkly dots, scattered across the sky.","But as I talked about in episode 2, when you look more closely you see differences.","The most obvious is that some look bright and some faint.","As I said then, sometimes that’s due to stars being at different distances, but it’s also true that stars emit different amounts of light, too.","If you look through binoculars or take pictures of stars, you’ll see that stars’re all different colors, too.","Some appear white, some red, orange, blue, and for a long time, the reason for this was a mystery.","In the waning years of the 19th century, astrophotography was becoming an important scientific tool.","Being able to hook a camera up to a telescope and take long exposures meant being able to see fainter objects, revealing previously hidden details.","It also meant that spectroscopy became a force, say it with me now, for science.","A spectrum is the result when you divide the incoming light from an object into individual colors, or wavelengths.","This reveals a vast amount of physical data about the object.","But in the late 1800s, we were only just starting to figure that out.","Interpreting stellar spectra was a tough problem.","The spectrum we measure from a star is a combination of two different kinds of spectra.","Stars are hot, dense balls of gas, so Stars give off a continuous spectrum; that is, Stars emit light at all wavelengths.","However, stars also have atmospheres, thinner layers of gas above the denser inner layers.","atmospheres, thinner layers of gas above the denser inner layers absorb light at specific wavelengths from the light below depending on the elements in Stars.","The result is that the continuous spectrum of a star has gaps in the continuous spectrum of a star, darker bands where different elements absorb different colors.","At first, stars were classified by the strengths of stars's hydrogen lines.","The strongest were called A stars, the next strongest B, then C, and so on.","But in 1901, a new system was introduced by spectroscopist Annie Jump Cannon, who dropped or merged a few of the old classifications, and then rearranged a few of the old classifications into one that classified stars by the strengths and appearances of many different absorption lines in stars's spectra.","A few years later, physicist Max Planck solved a thorny problem in physics, showing how objects like stars give off light of different colors based on objects like stars's temperature.","Hotter stars put out more light at the blue end of the spectrum, while cooler ones peaked in the red.","Around the same time, Bengali physicist Meghnad Saha solved another tough problem: how atoms give off light at different temperatures.","Two decades later, the brilliant astronomer Cecelia Payne-Gaposchkin put all these pieces together.","the brilliant astronomer Cecelia Payne-Gaposchkin showed that the spectra of stars depended on the temperature and elements in stars's atmospheres.","This unlocked the secrets of the stars, allowing astronomers to understand not just stars's composition but also many other physical traits.","For example, at the time, it was thought that stars had roughly the same composition as the Earth, but Payne-Gaposchkin showed that stars were overwhelmingly composed of hydrogen, with helium as the second most abundant element.","The classification scheme proposed by Cannon and decoded by Payne-Gaposchkin is still used today, and arranges stars by stars's temperature, assigning each a letter.","Because stars were rearranged from an older system the letters aren’t alphabetical: So the hottest are O-type stars, slightly cooler are B, followed by A, F, G, K, and M.","It’s a little weird, but many people use the mnemonic, “Oh Be A Fine Guy, Kiss Me,” or “Oh Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me,” to remember it — which was dreamed up by Annie Jump Cannon spectroscopist Annie Jump Cannon, who dropped or merged a few of the old classifications, and then rearranged them!","Each letter grouping is divided into 10 subgroups, again according to temperature.","We’ve also discovered even cooler stars in the past few decades, and even cooler stars are assigned the letters","L, T, and Y.","The Sun has a surface temperature of about 5500° Celsius, and is a G2 star.","A slightly hotter star would be a G1, and a slightly cooler  star a G3.","Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, is much hotter than the Sun, and is classified as an A0.","Betelgeuse, which is red and cool, is an M2.","Stars come in almost every color of the rainbow.","Hot stars are blue, cool stars red.","In between there are orange and even some yellow stars.","But there are no green stars.","Look as much as you want, and you won’t find any.","It’s because of the way our eyes see color.","A star can put out lots of green light, but if it does it’ll also emit red, blue, and orange.","And our eyes mix those together to form other colors.","A star can actually emit more green light than any other color, but we’ll wind up seeing it as white!","How do I know?","Because if you look at the sun’s spectrum, it actually peaks in the green!","Isn’t that weird?","The Sun puts out more green light than any other color, but our eyes see all the mixed colors together as white.","Wait, what?","White?","You may be thinking the Sun is actually yellow.","Not really.","The light from the Sun is white, but some of the shorter wavelengths like purple and blue and some green get scattered away by molecules of nitrogen in our air.","Those appear to be coming from every direction but the Sun, which is why the sky looks blue.","The Sun doesn’t emit much purple, so the sky doesn’t look purple, and the green doesn’t scatter as well as blue.","That gives the Sun a yellowish tint to our eyes, and looking at the Sun is painful anyway, so it’s hard to accurately gauge what color it appears.","That’s also why sunsets look orange or red",": You’re looking through more air on the horizon to see the Sun, so all the bluer light is scattered away.","So we can use spectra to determine a lot about a star.","But if you combine that with knowing a star’s distance, things get amazing.","You can measure how bright the star appears to be in your telescope, and by using the distance you can calculate how much energy","it’s","actually giving off — what astronomers call its luminosity.","An intrinsically faint light looks bright if it’s nearby, but so does a very luminous light far away.","By knowing the distance, you can correct for that, and figure out how luminous the objects actually are.","This was, no exaggeration, the key to understanding stars.","A lot of a star’s physical characteristics are related: Its luminosity depends on its size and temperature.","If two stars are the same size, but one is hotter, the hotter one will be more luminous.","If two stars are the same temperature, but one is bigger, the bigger one will be more luminous.","Knowing the temperature and distance means knowing the stars themselves.","Still, it’s a lot of data.","A century ago, spectra were taken of hundreds of thousands of stars!","How do you even start looking at all that?","The best way to understand a large group of objects is to look for trends.","Is there a relationship between color and distance?","How about temperature and size?","You compare and contrast them in as many ways possible and see what pops up.","I’ll spare you the work.","A century ago astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell made a graph, in ago astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris","they plotted a star’s luminosity versus its temperature.","When they did, they got a surprise: a VERY strong trend.","This is called an HR Diagram, after Hertzsprung and Russell.","It’s not an exaggeration to call it the single most important graph in all of astronomy!","In this graph, really bright stars are near the top, fainter ones near the bottom.","Hot, blue stars are on the left, and cool, red stars on the right.","The groups are pretty obvious!","There’s that thick line running diagonally down the middle, the clump to the upper right, and the smaller clump to the lower left.","This took a long time to fully understand, but now made a graph, in which they plotted a star’s luminosity versus its this diagram","is showing stars how stars live their lives.","Most stars fall into that thick line, and that’s why astronomers call it the Main Sequence.","The term is a little misleading; it’s not really a sequence per se, but as usual in astronomy it’s an old term and we got stuck with it.","The reason the main sequence is a broad, long line has to do with how stars make energy.","Like the Sun, stars generate energy by fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores.","A star that fuses hydrogen faster will be hotter, because it’s making more energy.","The rate of fusion depends on the pressure in a star’s core.","More massive stars can squeeze their cores harder, so they fuse faster and get hotter than low mass stars.","It’s pretty much that simple.","And The reason the main sequence!","Stars spend sequence of their lives fusing hydrogen into helium, which is why the main sequence has most of the stars on sequence has most of the stars; those are the ones merrily going about their starry business of making energy.","Massive stars are hotter and more luminous, so they fall on the upper left of the main sequence.","Stars with lower mass are cooler and redder, so they fall a little lower to the right, and so on.","The Sun is there, too, more or less in the middle.","What about the other groups?","Well, the stars on the lower left are hot, blue-white, but very faint.","Well, the stars on the means they must be small and","Well, the stars on the call them white dwarfs.","They’re the result of a star like the Sun eventually running out of hydrogen fuel.","We’ll get back to them in a future episode.","The stars on the upper right are luminous but cool.","They must therefore be huge.","These are red giants, also part of the dying process of stars like the Sun.","Above them are red SUPERgiants, massive stars beginning their death stage.","You can see some stars that are also that luminous but at the upper left; those are blue supergiants.","They’re more rare, but they too are the end stage for some stars, and again we’ll get to them soon enough in a future episode.","But I’ll just say here that it, um, doesn’t end well for them.","But, on a brighter note, we literally owe our existence to them.","And this implies something very nifty about the HR diagram: Stars can change position on it.","Not only that, but massive stars versus low mass stars age differently, and go to different parts of the HR diagram as they die.","In many ways, the diagram allows us to tell at a glance just what a star is doing with itself.","This difference between the way low mass stars like the Sun and higher mass stars age is actually critical to understanding a lot more about what we see in the sky… so much so that they’ll be handled separately in later episodes.","I’m sorry to tease so much about what’s to come, but this aspect of stars — finally understanding them physically — was a MAJOR step in astronomy, leading to understanding so much more.","And don’t you worry: we’ll get to all that.","Today you learned that stars can be categorized using their spectra.","Together with their distance, this provides a wealth of information about them including their luminosity, size, and temperature.","The HR diagram plots stars’ luminosity versus temperature, and most stars fall along the main sequence, where they live most of their lives.","Crash Course Astronomy is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios.","Head over to their YouTube channel and catch even

ERROR:root:payload: 'Twinkle, twinkle little star. Oh. I know who you are. At first glance, stars pretty much all look alike. Twinkly dots, scattered across the sky. But as I talked about in episode 2, when you look more closely you see differences. The most obvious is that some look bright and some faint. As I said then, sometimes that’s due to them being at different distances, but it’s also true that stars emit different amounts of light, too. If you look through binoculars or take pictures of them, you’ll see that they’re all different colors, too. Some appear white, some red, orange, blue, and for a long time, the reason for this was a mystery. In the waning years of the 19th century, astrophotography was becoming an important scientific tool. Being able to hook a camera up to a telescope and take long exposures meant being able to see fainter objects, revealing previously hidden details. It also meant that spectroscopy became a force, say it with me now, for science. A spectrum is the result when you divide the incoming light from an object into individual colors, or wavelengths. This reveals a vast amount of physical data about the object. But in the late 1800s, we were only just starting to figure that out. Interpreting stellar spectra was a tough problem. The spectrum we measure from a star is a combination of two different kinds of spectra. Stars are hot, dense balls of gas, so they give off a continuous spectrum; that is, they emit light at all wavelengths. However, stars also have atmospheres, thinner layers of gas above the denser inner layers. These gases absorb light at specific wavelengths from the light below depending on the elements in them. The result is that the continuous spectrum of a star has gaps in it, darker bands where different elements absorb different colors. At first, stars were classified by the strengths of their hydrogen lines. The strongest were called A stars, the next strongest B, then C, and so on. But in 1901, a new system was introduced by spectroscopist Annie Jump Cannon, who dropped or merged a few of the old classifications, and then rearranged them into one that classified stars by the strengths and appearances of many different absorption lines in their spectra. A few years later, physicist Max Planck solved a thorny problem in physics, showing how objects like stars give off light of different colors based on their temperature. Hotter stars put out more light at the blue end of the spectrum, while cooler ones peaked in the red. Around the same time, Bengali physicist Meghnad Saha solved another tough problem: how atoms give off light at different temperatures. Two decades later, the brilliant astronomer Cecelia Payne-Gaposchkin put all these pieces together. She showed that the spectra of stars depended on the temperature and elements in their atmospheres. This unlocked the secrets of the stars, allowing astronomers to understand not just their composition but also many other physical traits. For example, at the time, it was thought that stars had roughly the same composition as the Earth, but Payne-Gaposchkin showed that stars were overwhelmingly composed of hydrogen, with helium as the second most abundant element. The classification scheme proposed by Cannon and decoded by Payne-Gaposchkin is still used today, and arranges stars by their temperature, assigning each a letter. Because they were rearranged from an older system the letters aren’t alphabetical: So the hottest are O-type stars, slightly cooler are B, followed by A, F, G, K, and M. It’s a little weird, but many people use the mnemonic, “Oh Be A Fine Guy, Kiss Me,” or “Oh Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me,” to remember it — which was dreamed up by Annie Jump Cannon herself! Each letter grouping is divided into 10 subgroups, again according to temperature. We’ve also discovered even cooler stars in the past few decades, and these are assigned the letters L, T, and Y. The Sun has a surface temperature of about 5500° Celsius, and is a G2 star. A slightly hotter star would be a G1, and a slightly cooler  star a G3. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, is much hotter than the Sun, and is classified as an A0. Betelgeuse, which is red and cool, is an M2. Stars come in almost every color of the rainbow. Hot stars are blue, cool stars red. In between there are orange and even some yellow stars. But there are no green stars. Look as much as you want, and you won’t find any. It’s because of the way our eyes see color. A star can put out lots of green light, but if it does it’ll also emit red, blue, and orange. And our eyes mix those together to form other colors. A star can actually emit more green light than any other color, but we’ll wind up seeing it as white! How do I know? Because if you look at the sun’s spectrum, it actually peaks in the green! Isn’t that weird? The Sun puts out more green light than any other color, but our eyes see all the mixed colors together as white. Wait, what? White? You may be thinking the Sun is actually yellow. Not really. The light from the Sun is white, but some of the shorter wavelengths like purple and blue and some green get scattered away by molecules of nitrogen in our air. Those appear to be coming from every direction but the Sun, which is why the sky looks blue. The Sun doesn’t emit much purple, so the sky doesn’t look purple, and the green doesn’t scatter as well as blue. That gives the Sun a yellowish tint to our eyes, and looking at the Sun is painful anyway, so it’s hard to accurately gauge what color it appears. That’s also why sunsets look orange or red: You’re looking through more air on the horizon to see the Sun, so all the bluer light is scattered away. So we can use spectra to determine a lot about a star. But if you combine that with knowing a star’s distance, things get amazing. You can measure how bright the star appears to be in your telescope, and by using the distance you can calculate how much energy it’s actually giving off — what astronomers call its luminosity. An intrinsically faint light looks bright if it’s nearby, but so does a very luminous light far away. By knowing the distance, you can correct for that, and figure out how luminous the objects actually are. This was, no exaggeration, the key to understanding stars. A lot of a star’s physical characteristics are related: Its luminosity depends on its size and temperature. If two stars are the same size, but one is hotter, the hotter one will be more luminous. If two stars are the same temperature, but one is bigger, the bigger one will be more luminous. Knowing the temperature and distance means knowing the stars themselves. Still, it’s a lot of data. A century ago, spectra were taken of hundreds of thousands of stars! How do you even start looking at all that? The best way to understand a large group of objects is to look for trends. Is there a relationship between color and distance? How about temperature and size? You compare and contrast them in as many ways possible and see what pops up. I’ll spare you the work. A century ago astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell made a graph, in which they plotted a star’s luminosity versus its temperature. When they did, they got a surprise: a VERY strong trend. This is called an HR Diagram, after Hertzsprung and Russell. It’s not an exaggeration to call it the single most important graph in all of astronomy! In this graph, really bright stars are near the top, fainter ones near the bottom. Hot, blue stars are on the left, and cool, red stars on the right. The groups are pretty obvious! There’s that thick line running diagonally down the middle, the clump to the upper right, and the smaller clump to the lower left.  This took a long time to fully understand, but now we know this diagram is showing us how stars live their lives. Most stars fall into that thick line, and that’s why astronomers call it the Main Sequence. The term is a little misleading; it’s not really a sequence per se, but as usual in astronomy it’s an old term and we got stuck with it. The reason the main sequence is a broad, long line has to do with how stars make energy. Like the Sun, stars generate energy by fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores. A star that fuses hydrogen faster will be hotter, because it’s making more energy. The rate of fusion depends on the pressure in a star’s core. More massive stars can squeeze their cores harder, so they fuse faster and get hotter than low mass stars. It’s pretty much that simple. And that explains the main sequence! Stars spend most of their lives fusing hydrogen into helium, which is why the main sequence has most of the stars on it; those are the ones merrily going about their starry business of making energy. Massive stars are hotter and more luminous, so they fall on the upper left of the main sequence. Stars with lower mass are cooler and redder, so they fall a little lower to the right, and so on. The Sun is there, too, more or less in the middle. What about the other groups? Well, the stars on the lower left are hot, blue-white, but very faint. That means they must be small and we call them white dwarfs. They’re the result of a star like the Sun eventually running out of hydrogen fuel. We’ll get back to them in a future episode. The stars on the upper right are luminous but cool. They must therefore be huge. These are red giants, also part of the dying process of stars like the Sun. Above them are red SUPERgiants, massive stars beginning their death stage. You can see some stars that are also that luminous but at the upper left; those are blue supergiants. They’re more rare, but they too are the end stage for some stars, and again we’ll get to them soon enough in a future episode. But I’ll just say here that it, um, doesn’t end well for them. But, on a brighter note, we literally owe our existence to them. And this implies something very nifty about the HR diagram: Stars can change position on it. Not only that, but massive stars versus low mass stars age differently, and go to different parts of the HR diagram as they die. In many ways, the diagram allows us to tell at a glance just what a star is doing with itself. This difference between the way low mass stars like the Sun and higher mass stars age is actually critical to understanding a lot more about what we see in the sky… so much so that they’ll be handled separately in later episodes. I’m sorry to tease so much about what’s to come, but this aspect of stars — finally understanding them physically — was a MAJOR step in astronomy, leading to understanding so much more. And don’t you worry: we’ll get to all that. Today you learned that stars can be categorized using their spectra. Together with their distance, this provides a wealth of information about them including their luminosity, size, and temperature. The HR diagram plots stars’ luminosity versus temperature, and most stars fall along the main sequence, where they live most of their lives.

amounts of light, too.","If you look through binoculars or take pictures of stars, you’ll see that stars’re all different colors, too.","Some appear white, some red, orange, blue, and for a long time, the reason for this was a mystery.","In the waning years of the 19th century, astrophotography was becoming an important scientific tool.","Being able to hook a camera up to a telescope and take long exposures meant being able to see fainter objects, revealing previously hidden details.","It also meant that spectroscopy became a force, say it with me now, for science.","A spectrum is the result when you divide the incoming light from an object into individual colors, or wavelengths.","This reveals a vast amount of physical data about the object.","But in the late 1800s, we were only just starting to figure that out.","Interpreting stellar spectra was a tough problem.","The spectrum we measure from a star is a combination of two different kinds of spectra.","Stars are hot, dense balls of gas, so Stars give off a continuous spectrum; that is, Stars emit light at all wavelengths.","However, stars also have atmospheres, thinner layers of gas above the denser inner layers.","atmospheres, thinner layers of gas above the denser inner layers absorb light at specific wavelengths from the light below depending on the elements in Stars.","The result is that the continuous spectrum of a star has gaps in the continuous spectrum of a star, darker bands where different elements absorb different colors.","At first, stars were classified by the strengths of stars's hydrogen lines.","The strongest were called A stars, the next strongest B, then C, and so on.","But in 1901, a new system was introduced by spectroscopist Annie Jump Cannon, who dropped or

stars's spectra.","A few years later, physicist Max Planck solved a thorny problem in physics, showing how objects like stars give off light of different colors based on objects like stars's

Payne-Gaposchkin showed that the spectra of stars depended on the temperature and elements in stars's atmospheres.","This unlocked the secrets of the stars, allowing astronomers to understand not just

5500° Celsius, and is a G2 star.","A slightly hotter star would be a G1, and a slightly cooler  star a G3.","Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, is much hotter than the Sun, and is classified as an A0.","Betelgeuse, which is red and cool, is an M2.","Stars come in almost every color of the rainbow.","Hot stars are blue, cool stars red.","In between there are orange and even some yellow stars.","But there are no green stars.","Look as much as you want, and you won’t find any.","It’s because of the way our eyes see color.","A star can put out lots of green light, but if it does it’ll also emit red, blue, and orange.","And our eyes mix those together to form other colors.","A star can actually emit more green light than any other color, but we’ll wind up seeing it as white!","How do I know?","Because if you look at the sun’s spectrum, it actually peaks in the green!","Isn’t that weird?","The Sun puts out more green light than any other color, but our eyes see all the mixed colors together as white.","Wait, what?","White?","You may be thinking the Sun is actually yellow.","Not really.","The light from the Sun is white, but some of the shorter wavelengths like purple and blue and some green get scattered away by molecules of nitrogen in our air.","Those appear to be coming from every direction but the Sun, which is why the sky looks blue.","The Sun doesn’t emit much purple, so the sky doesn’t look purple, and the green doesn’t scatter as well as blue.","That gives the Sun a yellowish tint to our eyes, and looking at the Sun is painful anyway, so it’s hard to accurately gauge what color it appears.","That’s also why sunsets look orange or red",": You’re looking through more air on the horizon to see the Sun, so all the bluer light is scattered away.","So we can use spectra to determine a lot about a star.","But if you combine that with knowing a star’s distance, things get amazing.","You can measure how bright the star appears to be in your telescope, and by using the distance you can calculate how much energy","it’s","actually giving off — what astronomers call its luminosity.","An intrinsically faint light looks bright if it’s nearby, but so does a very luminous light far away.","By knowing the distance, you can correct for that, and figure out how luminous the objects actually are.","This was, no exaggeration, the key to understanding stars.","A lot of a star’s physical characteristics are related: Its luminosity depends on its size and temperature.","If two stars are the same size, but one is hotter, the hotter one will be more luminous.","If two stars are the same temperature, but one is bigger, the bigger one will be more luminous.","Knowing the temperature and distance means knowing the stars themselves.","Still, it’s a lot of data.","A century ago, spectra were taken of hundreds of thousands of stars!","How do you even start looking at all that?","The best way to understand a large group of objects is to look for trends.","Is there a relationship between color and distance?","How about temperature and size?","You compare and contrast them in as many ways possible and see what pops up.","I’ll spare you the work.","A century ago astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell made a graph, in ago astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris","they plotted a star’s luminosity versus its temperature.","When they did, they got a surprise: a VERY strong trend.","This is called an HR Diagram, after Hertzsprung and Russell.","It’s not an exaggeration to call it the single most important graph in all of astronomy!","In this graph, really bright stars are near the top, fainter ones near the bottom.","Hot, blue stars are on the left, and cool, red stars on the right.","The groups are pretty obvious!","There’s that thick line running diagonally down the middle, the clump to the upper right, and the smaller clump to the lower left.","This took a long time to fully understand, but now made a graph, in which they plotted a star’s luminosity versus its this diagram","is showing stars how stars live their lives.","Most stars fall into that thick line, and that’s why astronomers call it the Main Sequence.","The term is a little misleading; it’s not really a sequence per se, but as usual in astronomy it’s an old term and we got stuck with it.","The reason the main sequence is a broad, long line has to do with how stars make energy.","Like the Sun, stars generate energy by fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores.","A star that fuses hydrogen faster will be hotter, because it’s making more energy.","The rate of fusion depends on the pressure in a star’s core.","More massive stars can squeeze their cores harder, so they fuse faster and get hotter than low mass stars.","It’s pretty much that simple.","And The reason the main sequence!","Stars spend sequence of their lives fusing hydrogen into helium, which is why the main sequence has most of the stars on sequence has most of the stars; those are the ones merrily going about their starry business of making energy.","Massive stars are hotter and more luminous, so they fall on the upper left of the main sequence.","Stars with lower mass are cooler and redder, so they fall a little lower to the right, and so on.","The Sun is there, too, more or less in the middle.","What about the other groups?","Well, the stars on the lower left are hot, blue-white, but very faint.","Well, the stars on the means they must be small and","Well, the stars on the call them white dwarfs.","They’re the result of a star like the Sun eventually running out of hydrogen fuel.","We’ll get back to them in a future episode.","The stars on the upper right are luminous but cool.","They must therefore be huge.","These are red giants, also part of the dying process of stars like the Sun.","Above them are red SUPERgiants, massive stars beginning their death stage.","You can see some stars that are also that luminous but at the upper left; those are blue supergiants.","They’re more rare, but they too are the end stage for some stars, and again we’ll get to them soon enough in a future episode.","But I’ll just say here that it, um, doesn’t end well for them.","But, on a brighter note, we literally owe our existence to them.","And this implies something very nifty about the HR diagram: Stars can change position on it.","Not only that, but massive stars versus low mass stars age differently, and go to different parts of the HR diagram as they die.","In many ways, the diagram allows us to tell at a glance just what a star is doing with itself.","This difference between the way low mass stars like the Sun and higher mass stars age is actually critical to understanding a lot more about what we see in the sky… so much so that they’ll be handled separately in later episodes.","I’m sorry to tease so much about what’s to come, but this aspect of stars — finally understanding them physically — was a MAJOR step in astronomy, leading to understanding so much more.","And don’t you worry: we’ll get to all that.","Today you learned that stars can be categorized using their spectra.","Together with their distance, this provides a wealth of information about them including their luminosity, size, and temperature.","The HR diagram plots stars’ luminosity versus temperature, and most stars fall along the main sequence, where they live most of their lives.","Crash Course Astronomy is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios.","Head over to their YouTube channel and catch even

ERROR:root:payload: 'Twinkle, twinkle little star. Oh. I know who you are. At first glance, stars pretty much all look alike. Twinkly dots, scattered across the sky. But as I talked about in episode 2, when you look more closely you see differences. The most obvious is that some look bright and some faint. As I said then, sometimes that’s due to them being at different distances, but it’s also true that stars emit different amounts of light, too. If you look through binoculars or take pictures of them, you’ll see that they’re all different colors, too. Some appear white, some red, orange, blue, and for a long time, the reason for this was a mystery. In the waning years of the 19th century, astrophotography was becoming an important scientific tool. Being able to hook a camera up to a telescope and take long exposures meant being able to see fainter objects, revealing previously hidden details. It also meant that spectroscopy became a force, say it with me now, for science. A spectrum is the result when you divide the incoming light from an object into individual colors, or wavelengths. This reveals a vast amount of physical data about the object. But in the late 1800s, we were only just starting to figure that out. Interpreting stellar spectra was a tough problem. The spectrum we measure from a star is a combination of two different kinds of spectra. Stars are hot, dense balls of gas, so they give off a continuous spectrum; that is, they emit light at all wavelengths. However, stars also have atmospheres, thinner layers of gas above the denser inner layers. These gases absorb light at specific wavelengths from the light below depending on the elements in them. The result is that the continuous spectrum of a star has gaps in it, darker bands where different elements absorb different colors. At first, stars were classified by the strengths of their hydrogen lines. The strongest were called A stars, the next strongest B, then C, and so on. But in 1901, a new system was introduced by spectroscopist Annie Jump Cannon, who dropped or merged a few of the old classifications, and then rearranged them into one that classified stars by the strengths and appearances of many different absorption lines in their spectra. A few years later, physicist Max Planck solved a thorny problem in physics, showing how objects like stars give off light of different colors based on their temperature. Hotter stars put out more light at the blue end of the spectrum, while cooler ones peaked in the red. Around the same time, Bengali physicist Meghnad Saha solved another tough problem: how atoms give off light at different temperatures. Two decades later, the brilliant astronomer Cecelia Payne-Gaposchkin put all these pieces together. She showed that the spectra of stars depended on the temperature and elements in their atmospheres. This unlocked the secrets of the stars, allowing astronomers to understand not just their composition but also many other physical traits. For example, at the time, it was thought that stars had roughly the same composition as the Earth, but Payne-Gaposchkin showed that stars were overwhelmingly composed of hydrogen, with helium as the second most abundant element. The classification scheme proposed by Cannon and decoded by Payne-Gaposchkin is still used today, and arranges stars by their temperature, assigning each a letter. Because they were rearranged from an older system the letters aren’t alphabetical: So the hottest are O-type stars, slightly cooler are B, followed by A, F, G, K, and M. It’s a little weird, but many people use the mnemonic, “Oh Be A Fine Guy, Kiss Me,” or “Oh Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me,” to remember it — which was dreamed up by Annie Jump Cannon herself! Each letter grouping is divided into 10 subgroups, again according to temperature. We’ve also discovered even cooler stars in the past few decades, and these are assigned the letters L, T, and Y. The Sun has a surface temperature of about 5500° Celsius, and is a G2 star. A slightly hotter star would be a G1, and a slightly cooler  star a G3. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, is much hotter than the Sun, and is classified as an A0. Betelgeuse, which is red and cool, is an M2. Stars come in almost every color of the rainbow. Hot stars are blue, cool stars red. In between there are orange and even some yellow stars. But there are no green stars. Look as much as you want, and you won’t find any. It’s because of the way our eyes see color. A star can put out lots of green light, but if it does it’ll also emit red, blue, and orange. And our eyes mix those together to form other colors. A star can actually emit more green light than any other color, but we’ll wind up seeing it as white! How do I know? Because if you look at the sun’s spectrum, it actually peaks in the green! Isn’t that weird? The Sun puts out more green light than any other color, but our eyes see all the mixed colors together as white. Wait, what? White? You may be thinking the Sun is actually yellow. Not really. The light from the Sun is white, but some of the shorter wavelengths like purple and blue and some green get scattered away by molecules of nitrogen in our air. Those appear to be coming from every direction but the Sun, which is why the sky looks blue. The Sun doesn’t emit much purple, so the sky doesn’t look purple, and the green doesn’t scatter as well as blue. That gives the Sun a yellowish tint to our eyes, and looking at the Sun is painful anyway, so it’s hard to accurately gauge what color it appears. That’s also why sunsets look orange or red: You’re looking through more air on the horizon to see the Sun, so all the bluer light is scattered away. So we can use spectra to determine a lot about a star. But if you combine that with knowing a star’s distance, things get amazing. You can measure how bright the star appears to be in your telescope, and by using the distance you can calculate how much energy it’s actually giving off — what astronomers call its luminosity. An intrinsically faint light looks bright if it’s nearby, but so does a very luminous light far away. By knowing the distance, you can correct for that, and figure out how luminous the objects actually are. This was, no exaggeration, the key to understanding stars. A lot of a star’s physical characteristics are related: Its luminosity depends on its size and temperature. If two stars are the same size, but one is hotter, the hotter one will be more luminous. If two stars are the same temperature, but one is bigger, the bigger one will be more luminous. Knowing the temperature and distance means knowing the stars themselves. Still, it’s a lot of data. A century ago, spectra were taken of hundreds of thousands of stars! How do you even start looking at all that? The best way to understand a large group of objects is to look for trends. Is there a relationship between color and distance? How about temperature and size? You compare and contrast them in as many ways possible and see what pops up. I’ll spare you the work. A century ago astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell made a graph, in which they plotted a star’s luminosity versus its temperature. When they did, they got a surprise: a VERY strong trend. This is called an HR Diagram, after Hertzsprung and Russell. It’s not an exaggeration to call it the single most important graph in all of astronomy! In this graph, really bright stars are near the top, fainter ones near the bottom. Hot, blue stars are on the left, and cool, red stars on the right. The groups are pretty obvious! There’s that thick line running diagonally down the middle, the clump to the upper right, and the smaller clump to the lower left.  This took a long time to fully understand, but now we know this diagram is showing us how stars live their lives. Most stars fall into that thick line, and that’s why astronomers call it the Main Sequence. The term is a little misleading; it’s not really a sequence per se, but as usual in astronomy it’s an old term and we got stuck with it. The reason the main sequence is a broad, long line has to do with how stars make energy. Like the Sun, stars generate energy by fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores. A star that fuses hydrogen faster will be hotter, because it’s making more energy. The rate of fusion depends on the pressure in a star’s core. More massive stars can squeeze their cores harder, so they fuse faster and get hotter than low mass stars. It’s pretty much that simple. And that explains the main sequence! Stars spend most of their lives fusing hydrogen into helium, which is why the main sequence has most of the stars on it; those are the ones merrily going about their starry business of making energy. Massive stars are hotter and more luminous, so they fall on the upper left of the main sequence. Stars with lower mass are cooler and redder, so they fall a little lower to the right, and so on. The Sun is there, too, more or less in the middle. What about the other groups? Well, the stars on the lower left are hot, blue-white, but very faint. That means they must be small and we call them white dwarfs. They’re the result of a star like the Sun eventually running out of hydrogen fuel. We’ll get back to them in a future episode. The stars on the upper right are luminous but cool. They must therefore be huge. These are red giants, also part of the dying process of stars like the Sun. Above them are red SUPERgiants, massive stars beginning their death stage. You can see some stars that are also that luminous but at the upper left; those are blue supergiants. They’re more rare, but they too are the end stage for some stars, and again we’ll get to them soon enough in a future episode. But I’ll just say here that it, um, doesn’t end well for them. But, on a brighter note, we literally owe our existence to them. And this implies something very nifty about the HR diagram: Stars can change position on it. Not only that, but massive stars versus low mass stars age differently, and go to different parts of the HR diagram as they die. In many ways, the diagram allows us to tell at a glance just what a star is doing with itself. This difference between the way low mass stars like the Sun and higher mass stars age is actually critical to understanding a lot more about what we see in the sky… so much so that they’ll be handled separately in later episodes. I’m sorry to tease so much about what’s to come, but this aspect of stars — finally understanding them physically — was a MAJOR step in astronomy, leading to understanding so much more. And don’t you worry: we’ll get to all that. Today you learned that stars can be categorized using their spectra. Together with their distance, this provides a wealth of information about them including their luminosity, size, and temperature. The HR diagram plots stars’ luminosity versus temperature, and most stars fall along the main sequence, where they live most of their lives.

Not really. The light from the Sun is white, but some of the shorter wavelengths like purple and blue and some green get scattered away by molecules of nitrogen in our air. Those appear to be coming from every direction but the Sun, which is why the sky looks blue. The Sun doesn’t emit much purple, so the sky doesn’t look purple, and the green doesn’t scatter as well as blue. That gives the Sun a yellowish tint to our eyes, and looking at the Sun is painful anyway, so it’s hard to accurately gauge what color it appears. That’s also why sunsets look orange or red: You’re looking through more air on the horizon to see the Sun, so all the bluer light is scattered away. So we can use spectra to determine a lot about a star. But if you combine that with knowing a star’s distance, things get amazing. You can measure how bright the star appears to be in your telescope, and by using the distance you can calculate how much energy it’s actually giving off — what astronomers call its luminosity. An intrinsically faint light looks bright if it’s nearby, but so does a very luminous light far away. By knowing the distance, you can correct for that, and figure out how luminous the objects actually are. This was, no exaggeration, the key to understanding stars. A lot of a star’s physical characteristics are related: Its luminosity depends on its size and temperature. If two stars are the same size, but one is hotter, the hotter one will be more luminous. If two stars are the same temperature, but one is bigger, the bigger one will be more luminous. Knowing the temperature and distance means knowing the stars themselves. Still, it’s a lot of data. A century ago, spectra were taken of hundreds of thousands of stars! How do you even start looking at all that? The best way to understand a large group of objects is to look for trends. Is there a relationship between color and distance? How about temperature and size? You compare and contrast them in as many ways possible and see what pops up. I’ll spare you the work. A century ago astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell made a graph, in which they plotted a star’s luminosity versus its temperature. When they did, they got a surprise: a VERY strong trend. This is called an HR Diagram, after Hertzsprung and Russell. It’s not an exaggeration to call it the single most important graph in all of astronomy! In this graph, really bright stars are near the top, fainter ones near the bottom. Hot, blue stars are on the left, and cool, red stars on the right. The groups are pretty obvious! There’s that thick line running diagonally down the middle, the clump to the upper right, and the smaller clump to the lower left.  This took a long time to fully understand, but now we know this diagram is showing us how stars live their lives. Most stars fall into that thick line, and that’s why astronomers call it the Main Sequence. The term is a little misleading; it’s not really a sequence per se, but as usual in astronomy it’s an old term and we got stuck with it. The reason the main sequence is a broad, long line has to do with how stars make energy. Like the Sun, stars generate energy by fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores. A star that fuses hydrogen faster will be hotter, because it’s making more energy. The rate of fusion depends on the pressure in a star’s core. More massive stars can squeeze their cores harder, so they fuse faster and get hotter than low mass stars. It’s pretty much that simple. And that explains the main sequence! Stars spend most of their lives fusing hydrogen into helium, which is why the main sequence has most of the stars on it; those are the ones merrily going about their starry business of making energy. Massive stars are hotter and more luminous, so they fall on the upper left of the main sequence. Stars with lower mass are cooler and redder, so they fall a little lower to the right, and so on. The Sun is there, too, more or less in the middle. What about the other groups? Well, the stars on the lower left are hot, blue-white, but very faint. That means they must be small and we call them white dwarfs. They’re the result of a star like the Sun eventually running out of hydrogen fuel. We’ll get back to them in a future episode. The stars on the upper right are luminous but cool. They must therefore be huge. These are red giants, also part of the dying process of stars like the Sun. Above them are red SUPERgiants, massive stars beginning their death stage. You can see some stars that are also that luminous but at the upper left; those are blue supergiants. They’re more rare, but they too are the end stage for some stars, and again we’ll get to them soon enough in a future episode. But I’ll just say here that it, um, doesn’t end well for them. But, on a brighter note, we literally owe our existence to them. And this implies something very nifty about the HR diagram: Stars can change position on it. Not only that, but massive stars versus low mass stars age differently, and go to different parts of the HR diagram as they die. In many ways, the diagram allows us to tell at a glance just what a star is doing with itself. This difference between the way low mass stars like the Sun and higher mass stars age is actually critical to understanding a lot more about what we see in the sky… so much so that they’ll be handled separately in later episodes. I’m sorry to tease so much about what’s to come, but this aspect of stars — finally understanding them physically — was a MAJOR step in astronomy, leading to understanding so much more. And don’t you worry: we’ll get to all that. Today you learned that stars can be categorized using their spectra. Together with their distance, this provides a wealth of information about them including their luminosity, size, and temperature. The HR diagram plots stars’ luminosity versus temperature, and most stars fall along the main sequence, where they live most of their lives.

Each letter grouping is divided into 10 subgroups, again according to temperature. We’ve also discovered even cooler stars in the past few decades, and these are assigned the letters L, T, and Y. The Sun has a surface temperature of about 5500° Celsius, and is a G2 star. A slightly hotter star would be a G1, and a slightly cooler  star a G3. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, is much hotter than the Sun, and is classified as an A0. Betelgeuse, which is red and cool, is an M2. Stars come in almost every color of the rainbow. Hot stars are blue, cool stars red. In between there are orange and even some yellow stars. But there are no green stars. Look as much as you want, and you won’t find any. It’s because of the way our eyes see color. A star can put out lots of green light, but if it does it’ll also emit red, blue, and orange. And our eyes mix those together to form other colors. A star can actually emit more green light than any other color, but we’ll wind up seeing it as white! How do I know? Because if you look at the sun’s spectrum, it actually peaks in the green! Isn’t that weird? The Sun puts out more green light than any other color, but our eyes see all the mixed colors together as white. Wait, what? White? You may be thinking the Sun is actually yellow. Not really. The light from the Sun is white, but some of the shorter wavelengths like purple and blue and some green get scattered away by molecules of nitrogen in our air. Those appear to be coming from every direction but the Sun, which is why the sky looks blue. The Sun doesn’t emit much purple, so the sky doesn’t look purple, and the green doesn’t scatter as well as blue. That gives the Sun a yellowish tint to our eyes, and looking at the Sun is painful anyway, so it’s hard to accurately gauge what color it appears. That’s also why sunsets look orange or red: You’re looking through more air on the horizon to see the Sun, so all the bluer light is scattered away. So we can use spectra to determine a lot about a star. But if you combine that with knowing a star’s distance, things get amazing. You can measure how bright the star appears to be in your telescope, and by using the distance you can calculate how much energy it’s actually giving off — what astronomers call its luminosity. An intrinsically faint light looks bright if it’s nearby, but so does a very luminous light far away. By knowing the distance, you can correct for that, and figure out how luminous the objects actually are. This was, no exaggeration, the key to understanding stars. A lot of a star’s physical characteristics are related: Its luminosity depends on its size and temperature. If two stars are the same size, but one is hotter, the hotter one will be more luminous. If two stars are the same temperature, but one is bigger, the bigger one will be more luminous. Knowing the temperature and distance means knowing the stars themselves. Still, it’s a lot of data. A century ago, spectra were taken of hundreds of thousands of stars! How do you even start looking at all that? The best way to understand a large group of objects is to look for trends. Is there a relationship between color and distance? How about temperature and size? You compare and contrast them in as many ways possible and see what pops up. I’ll spare you the work. A century ago astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell made a graph, in which they plotted a star’s luminosity versus its temperature. When they did, they got a surprise: a VERY strong trend. This is called an HR Diagram, after Hertzsprung and Russell. It’s not an exaggeration to call it the single most important graph in all of astronomy! In this graph, really bright stars are near the top, fainter ones near the bottom. Hot, blue stars are on the left, and cool, red stars on the right. The groups are pretty obvious! There’s that thick line running diagonally down the middle, the clump to the upper right, and the smaller clump to the lower left.  This took a long time to fully understand, but now we know this diagram is showing us how stars live their lives. Most stars fall into that thick line, and that’s why astronomers call it the Main Sequence. The term is a little misleading; it’s not really a sequence per se, but as usual in astronomy it’s an old term and we got stuck with it. The reason the main sequence is a broad, long line has to do with how stars make energy. Like the Sun, stars generate energy by fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores. A star that fuses hydrogen faster will be hotter, because it’s making more energy. The rate of fusion depends on the pressure in a star’s core. More massive stars can squeeze their cores harder, so they fuse faster and get hotter than low mass stars. It’s pretty much that simple. And that explains the main sequence! Stars spend most of their lives fusing hydrogen into helium, which is why the main sequence has most of the stars on it; those are the ones merrily going about their starry business of making energy. Massive stars are hotter and more luminous, so they fall on the upper left of the main sequence. Stars with lower mass are cooler and redder, so they fall a little lower to the right, and so on. The Sun is there, too, more or less in the middle. What about the other groups? Well, the stars on the lower left are hot, blue-white, but very faint. That means they must be small and we call them white dwarfs. They’re the result of a star like the Sun eventually running out of hydrogen fuel. We’ll get back to them in a future episode. The stars on the upper right are luminous but cool. They must therefore be huge. These are red giants, also part of the dying process of stars like the Sun. Above them are red SUPERgiants, massive stars beginning their death stage. You can see some stars that are also that luminous but at the upper left; those are blue supergiants. They’re more rare, but they too are the end stage for some stars, and again we’ll get to them soon enough in a future episode. But I’ll just say here that it, um, doesn’t end well for them. But, on a brighter note, we literally owe our existence to them. And this implies something very nifty about the HR diagram: Stars can change position on it. Not only that, but massive stars versus low mass stars age differently, and go to different parts of the HR diagram as they die. In many ways, the diagram allows us to tell at a glance just what a star is doing with itself. This difference between the way low mass stars like the Sun and higher mass stars age is actually critical to understanding a lot more about what we see in the sky… so much so that they’ll be handled separately in later episodes. I’m sorry to tease so much about what’s to come, but this aspect of stars — finally understanding them physically — was a MAJOR step in astronomy, leading to understanding so much more. And don’t you worry: we’ll get to all that. Today you learned that stars can be categorized using their spectra. Together with their distance, this provides a wealth of information about them including their luminosity, size, and temperature. The HR diagram plots stars’ luminosity versus temperature, and most stars fall along the main sequence, where they live most of their lives.

ERROR:root:orig input: ' Twinkle, twinkle little star. Oh. I know who you are. At first glance, stars pretty much all look alike. Twinkly dots, scattered across the sky. But as I talked about in episode 2, when you look more closely you see differences. The most obvious is that some look bright and some faint. As I said then, sometimes that’s due to them being at different distances, but it’s also true that stars emit different amounts of light, too. If you look through binoculars or take pictures of them, you’ll see that they’re all different colors, too. Some appear white, some red, orange, blue, and for a long time, the reason for this was a mystery. In the waning years of the 19th century, astrophotography was becoming an important scientific tool. Being able to hook a camera up to a telescope and take long exposures meant being able to see fainter objects, revealing previously hidden details. It also meant that spectroscopy became a force, say it with me now, for science. A spectrum is the result when you divide the incoming light from an object into individual colors, or wavelengths. This reveals a vast amount of physical data about the object. But in the late 1800s, we were only just starting to figure that out. Interpreting stellar spectra was a tough problem. The spectrum we measure from a star is a combination of two different kinds of spectra. Stars are hot, dense balls of gas, so they give off a continuous spectrum; that is, they emit light at all wavelengths. However, stars also have atmospheres, thinner layers of gas above the denser inner layers. These gases absorb light at specific wavelengths from the light below depending on the elements in them. The result is that the continuous spectrum of a star has gaps in it, darker bands where different elements absorb different colors. At first, stars were classified by the strengths of their hydrogen lines. The strongest were called A stars, the next strongest B, then C, and so on. But in 1901, a new system was introduced by spectroscopist Annie Jump Cannon, who dropped or merged a few of the old classifications, and then rearranged them into one that classified stars by the strengths and appearances of many different absorption lines in their spectra. A few years later, physicist Max Planck solved a thorny problem in physics, showing how objects like stars give off light of different colors based on their temperature. Hotter stars put out more light at the blue end of the spectrum, while cooler ones peaked in the red. Around the same time, Bengali physicist Meghnad Saha solved another tough problem: how atoms give off light at different temperatures. Two decades later, the brilliant astronomer Cecelia Payne-Gaposchkin put all these pieces together. She showed that the spectra of stars depended on the temperature and elements in their atmospheres. This unlocked the secrets of the stars, allowing astronomers to understand not just their composition but also many other physical traits. For example, at the time, it was thought that stars had roughly the same composition as the Earth, but Payne-Gaposchkin showed that stars were overwhelmingly composed of hydrogen, with helium as the second most abundant element. The classification scheme proposed by Cannon and decoded by Payne-Gaposchkin is still used today, and arranges stars by their temperature, assigning each a letter. Because they were rearranged from an older system the letters aren’t alphabetical: So the hottest are O-type stars, slightly cooler are B, followed by A, F, G, K, and M. It’s a little weird, but many people use the mnemonic, “Oh Be A Fine Guy, Kiss Me,” or “Oh Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me,” to remember it — which was dreamed up by Annie Jump Cannon herself!

sequence has most of the stars; those are the ones merrily going about their starry business of making energy.","Massive stars are hotter and more luminous, so they fall on the upper left of the main sequence.","Stars with lower mass are cooler and redder, so they fall a little lower to the right, and so on.","The Sun is there, too, more or less in the middle.","What about the other groups?","Well, the stars on the lower left are hot, blue-white, but very faint.","Well, the stars on the means they must be small and","Well, the stars on the call them white dwarfs.","They’re the result of a star like the Sun eventually running out of hydrogen fuel.","We’ll get back to them in a future episode.","The stars on the upper right are luminous but cool.","They must therefore be huge.","These are red giants, also part of the dying process of stars like the Sun.","Above them are red SUPERgiants, massive stars beginning their death stage.","You can see some stars that are also that luminous but at the upper left; those are blue supergiants.","They’re more rare, but they too are the end stage for some stars, and again we’ll get to them soon enough in a future episode.","But I’ll just say here that it, um, doesn’t end well for them.","But, on a brighter note, we literally owe our existence to them.","And this implies something very nifty about the HR diagram: Stars can change position on it.","Not only that, but massive stars versus low mass stars age differently, and go to different parts of the HR diagram as they die.","In many ways, the diagram allows us to tell at a glance just what a star is doing with itself.","This difference between the way low mass stars like the Sun and higher mass stars age is actually critical to understanding a lot more about what we see in the sky… so much so that they’ll be handled separately in later episodes.","I’m sorry to tease so much about what’s to come, but this aspect of stars — finally understanding them physically — was a MAJOR step in astronomy, leading to understanding so much more.","And don’t you worry: we’ll get to all that.","Today you learned that stars can be categorized using their spectra.","Together with their distance, this provides a wealth of information about them including their luminosity, size, and temperature.","The HR diagram plots stars’ luminosity versus temperature, and most stars fall along the main sequence, where they live most of their lives.","Crash Course Astronomy is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios.","Head over to their YouTube channel and catch even more awesome videos.","This episode was written by me, Phil Plait.","The script was edited by Blake de Pastino, and our consultant is Dr. Michelle Thaller.","It was directed by Nicholas Jenkins,

ERROR:root:payload: "This is a three. It's sloppily written and rendered at an extremely low resolution of 28 by 28 pixels. But your brain has no trouble recognizing it as a three and I want you to take a moment to appreciate How crazy it is that brains can do this so effortlessly? I mean this this and this are also recognizable as threes, even though the specific values of each pixel is very different from one image to the next. The particular light-sensitive cells in your eye that are firing when you see this three are very different from the ones firing when you see this three. But something in that crazy smart visual cortex of yours resolves these as representing the same idea while at the same time recognizing other images as their own distinct ideas But if I told you hey sit down and write for me a program that takes in a grid of 28 by 28 pixels like this and outputs a single number between 0 and 10 telling you what it thinks the digit is Well the task goes from comically trivial to dauntingly difficult Unless you've been living under a rock I think I hardly need to motivate the relevance and importance of machine learning and neural networks to the present into the future But what I want to do here is show you what a neural network actually is Assuming no background and to help visualize what it's doing not as a buzzword but as a piece of math My hope is just that you come away feeling like this structure itself is Motivated and to feel like you know what it means when you read or you hear about a neural network quote-unquote learning This video is just going to be devoted to the structure component of that and the following one is going to tackle learning What we're going to do is put together a neural network that can learn to recognize handwritten digits This is a somewhat classic example for Introducing the topic and I'm happy to stick with the status quo here because at the end of the two videos I want to point You to a couple good resources where you can learn more and where you can download the code that does this and play with it? on your own computer There are many many variants of neural networks and in recent years There's been sort of a boom in research towards these variants But in these two introductory videos you and I are just going to look at the simplest plain-vanilla form with no added frills This is kind of a necessary prerequisite for understanding any of the more powerful modern variants and Trust me it still has plenty of complexity for us to wrap our minds around But even in this simplest form it can learn to recognize handwritten digits Which is a pretty cool thing for a computer to be able to do. And at the same time you'll see how it does fall short of a couple hopes that we might have for it As the name suggests neural networks are inspired by the brain, but let's break that down What are the neurons and in what sense are they linked together? Right now when I say neuron all I want you to think about is a thing that holds a number Specifically a number between 0 & 1 it's really not more than that For example the network starts with a bunch of neurons corresponding to each of the 28 times 28 pixels of the input image which is 784 neurons in total each one of these holds a number that represents the grayscale value of the corresponding pixel ranging from 0 for black pixels up to 1 for white pixels This number inside the neuron is called its activation and the image you might have in mind here Is that each neuron is lit up when its activation is a high number? So all of these 784 neurons make up the first layer of our network Now jumping over to the last layer this has ten neurons each representing one of the digits the activation in these neurons again some number that's between zero and one Represents how much the system thinks that a given image? Corresponds with a given digit. There's also a couple layers in between called the hidden layers Which for the time being? Should just be a giant question mark for how on earth this process of recognizing digits is going to be handled In this network I chose two hidden layers each one with 16 neurons and admittedly that's kind of an arbitrary choice to be honest I chose two layers based on how I want to motivate the structure in just a moment and 16 well that was just a nice number to fit on the screen in practice There is a lot of room for experiment with a specific structure here The way the network operates activations in one layer determine the activations of the next layer And of course the heart of the network as an information processing mechanism comes down to exactly how those activations from one layer bring about activations in the next layer It's meant to be loosely analogous to how in biological networks of neurons some groups of neurons firing cause certain others to fire Now the network I'm showing here has already been trained to recognize digits and let me show you what I mean by that It means if you feed in an image lighting up all 784 neurons of the input layer according to the brightness of each pixel in the image That pattern of activations causes some very specific pattern in the next layer Which causes some pattern in the one after it? Which finally gives some pattern in the output layer and? The brightest neuron of that output layer is the network's choice so to speak for what digit this image represents? And before jumping into the math for how one layer influences the next or how training works? Let's just talk about why it's even reasonable to expect a layered structure like this to behave intelligently What are we expecting here? What is the best hope for what those middle layers might be doing? Well when you or I recognize digits we piece together various components a nine has a loop up top and a line on the right an 8 also has a loop up top, but it's paired with another loop down low A 4 basically breaks down into three specific lines and things like that Now in a perfect world we might hope that each neuron in the second-to-last layer corresponds with one of these sub components That anytime you feed in an image with say a loop up top like a 9 or an 8 There's some specific Neuron whose activation is going to be close to one and I don't mean this specific loop of pixels the hope would be that any Generally loopy pattern towards the top sets off this neuron that way going from the third layer to the last one just requires learning which combination of sub components corresponds to which digits Of course that just kicks the problem down the road Because how would you recognize these sub components or even learn what the right sub components should be and I still haven't even talked about How one layer influences the next but run with me on this one for a moment recognizing a loop can also break down into subproblems One reasonable way to do this would be to first recognize the various little edges that make it up Similarly a long line like the kind you might see in the digits 1 or 4 or 7 Well that's really just a long edge or maybe you think of it as a certain pattern of several smaller edges So maybe our hope is that each neuron in the second layer of the network corresponds with the various relevant little edges Maybe when an image like this one comes in it lights up all of the neurons associated with around eight to ten specific little edges which in turn lights up the neurons associated with the upper loop and a long vertical line and Those light up the neuron associated with a nine whether or not This is what our final network actually does is another question, one that I'll come back to once we see how to train the network But this is a hope that we might have. A sort of goal with the layered structure like this Moreover you can imagine how being able to detect edges and patterns like this would be really useful for other image recognition tasks And even beyond image recognition there are all sorts of intelligent things you might want to do that break down into layers of abstraction Parsing speech for example involves taking raw audio and picking out distinct sounds which combine to make certain syllables Which combine to form words which combine to make up phrases and more abstract thoughts etc But getting back to how any of this actually works picture yourself right now designing How exactly the activations in one layer might determine the activations in the next? The goal is to have some mechanism that could conceivably combine pixels into edges Or edges into patterns or patterns into digits and to zoom in on one very specific example Let's say the hope is for one particular Neuron in the second layer to pick up on whether or not the image has an edge in this region here The question at hand is what parameters should the network have what dials and knobs should you be able to tweak so that it's expressive enough to potentially capture this pattern or Any other pixel pattern or the pattern that several edges can make a loop and other such things? Well, what we'll do is assign a weight to each one of the connections between our neuron and the neurons from the first layer These weights are just numbers then take all those activations from the first layer and compute their weighted sum according to these weights I Find it helpful to think of these weights as being organized into a little grid of their own And I'm going to use green pixels to indicate positive weights and red pixels to indicate negative weights Where the brightness of that pixel is some loose depiction of the weights value? Now if we made the weights associated with almost all of the pixels zero except for some positive weights in this region that we care about then taking the weighted sum of all the pixel values really just amounts to adding up the values of the pixel just in the region that we care about And, if you really want it to pick up on whether there's an edge here what you might do is have some negative weights associated with the surrounding pixels Then the sum is largest when those middle pixels are bright, but the surrounding pixels are darker When you compute a weighted sum like this you might come out with any number but for this network what we want is for activations to be some value between 0 & 1 so a common thing to do is to pump this weighted sum Into some function that squishes the real number line into the range between 0 & 1 and A common function that does this is called the sigmoid function also known as a logistic curve basically very negative inputs end up close to zero very positive inputs end up close to 1 and it just steadily increases around the input 0 So the activation of the neuron here is basically a measure of how positive the relevant weighted sum is But maybe it's not that you want the neuron to light up when the weighted sum is bigger than 0 Maybe you only want it to be active when the sum is bigger than say 10 That is you want some bias for it to be inactive what we'll do then is just add in some other number like negative 10 to this weighted sum Before plugging it through the sigmoid squishification function That additional number is called the bias So the weights tell you what pixel pattern this neuron in the second layer is picking up on and the bias tells you how high the weighted sum needs to be before the neuron starts getting meaningfully active And that is just one neuron Every other neuron in this layer is going to be connected to all 784 pixels neurons from the first layer and each one of those 784 connections has its own weight associated with it also each one has some bias some other number that you add on to the weighted sum before squishing it with the sigmoid and That's a lot to think about with this hidden layer of 16 neurons that's a total of 784 times 16 weights along with 16 biases And all of that is just the connections from the first layer to the second the connections between the other layers Also, have a bunch of weights and biases associated with them All said and done this network has almost exactly 13,000 total weights and biases 13,000 knobs and dials that can be tweaked and turned to make this network behave in different ways So when we talk about learning? What that's referring to is getting the computer to find a valid setting for all of these many many numbers so that it'll actually solve the problem at hand one thought Experiment that is at once fun and kind of horrifying is to imagine sitting down and setting all of these weights and biases by hand Purposefully tweaking the numbers so that the second layer picks up on edges the third layer picks up on patterns etc I personally find this satisfying rather than just reading the network as a total black box Because when the network doesn't perform the way you anticipate if you've built up a little bit of a relationship with what those weights and biases actually mean you have a starting place for Experimenting with how to change the structure to improve or when the network does work? But not for the reasons you might expect Digging into what the weights and biases are doing is a good way to challenge your assumptions and really expose the full space of possible solutions By the way the actual function here is a little cumbersome to write down. Don't you think? So let me show you a more notationally compact way that these connections are represented. This is how you'd see it If you choose to read up more about neural networks Organize all of the activations from one layer into a column as a vector Then organize all of the weights as a matrix where each row of that matrix corresponds to the connections between one layer and a particular neuron in the next layer What that means is that taking the weighted sum of the activations in the first layer according to these weights? Corresponds to one of the terms in the matrix vector product of everything we have on the left here By the way so much of machine learning just comes down to having a good grasp of linear algebra So for any of you who want a nice visual understanding for matrices and what matrix vector multiplication means take a look at the series I did on linear algebra especially chapter three Back to our expression instead of talking about adding the bias to each one of these values independently we represent it by Organizing all those biases into a vector and adding the entire vector to the previous matrix vector product Then as a final step I'll rap a sigmoid around the outside here And what that's supposed to represent is that you're going to apply the sigmoid function to each specific component of the resulting vector inside So once you write down this weight matrix and these vectors as their own symbols you can communicate the full transition of activations from one layer to the next in an extremely tight and neat little expression and This makes the relevant code both a lot simpler and a lot faster since many libraries optimize the heck out of matrix multiplication Remember how earlier I said these neurons are simply things that hold numbers Well of course the specific numbers that they hold depends on the image you feed in So it's actually more accurate to think of each neuron as a function one that takes in the outputs of all the neurons in the previous layer and spits out a number between zero and one Really the entire network is just a function one that takes in 784 numbers as an input and spits out ten numbers as an output It's an absurdly Complicated function one that involves thirteen thousand parameters in the forms of these weights and biases that pick up on certain patterns and which involves iterating many matrix vector products and the sigmoid squish evocation function But it's just a function nonetheless and in a way it's kind of reassuring that it looks complicated I mean if it were any simpler what hope would we have that it could take on the challenge of recognizing digits? And how does it take on that challenge? How does this network learn the appropriate weights and biases just by looking at data? Oh?

ERROR:root:orig input: " This is a three. It's sloppily written and rendered at an extremely low resolution of 28 by 28 pixels. But your brain has no trouble recognizing it as a three and I want you to take a moment to appreciate How crazy it is that brains can do this so effortlessly? I mean this this and this are also recognizable as threes, even though the specific values of each pixel is very different from one image to the next. The particular light-sensitive cells in your eye that are firing when you see this three are very different from the ones firing when you see this three. But something in that crazy smart visual cortex of yours resolves these as representing the same idea while at the same time recognizing other images as their own distinct ideas But if I told you hey sit down and write for me a program that takes in a grid of 28 by 28 pixels like this and outputs a single number between 0 and 10 telling you what it thinks the digit is Well the task goes from comically trivial to dauntingly difficult Unless you've been living under a rock I think I hardly need to motivate the relevance and importance of machine learning and neural networks to the present into the future But what I want to do here is show you what a neural network actually is Assuming no background and to help visualize what it's doing not as a buzzword but as a piece of math My hope is just that you come away feeling like this structure itself is Motivated and to feel like you know what it means when you read or you hear about a neural network quote-unquote learning This video is just going to be devoted to the structure component of that and the following one is going to tackle learning What we're going to do is put together a neural network that can learn to recognize handwritten digits This is a somewhat classic example for Introducing the topic and I'm happy to stick with the status quo here because at the end of the two videos I want to point You to a couple good resources where you can learn more and where you can download the code that does this and play with it? on your own computer There are many many variants of neural networks and in recent years There's been sort of a boom in research towards these variants But in these two introductory videos you and I are just going to look at the simplest plain-vanilla form with no added frills This is kind of a necessary prerequisite for understanding any of the more powerful modern variants and Trust me it still has plenty of complexity for us to wrap our minds around But even in this simplest form it can learn to recognize handwritten digits Which is a pretty cool thing for a computer to be able to do. And at the same time you'll see how it does fall short of a couple hopes that we might have for it As the name suggests neural networks are inspired by the brain, but let's break that down What are the neurons and in what sense are they linked together? Right now when I say neuron all I want you to think about is a thing that holds a number Specifically a number between 0 & 1 it's really not more than that For example the network starts with a bunch of neurons corresponding to each of the 28 times 28 pixels of the input image which is 784 neurons in total each one of these holds a number that represents the grayscale value of the corresponding pixel ranging from 0 for black pixels up to 1 for white pixels This number inside the neuron is called its activation and the image you might have in mind here Is that each neuron is lit up when its activation is a high number? So all of these 784 neurons make up the first layer of our network Now jumping over to the last layer this has ten neurons each representing one of the digits the activation in these neurons again some number that's between zero and one Represents how much the system thinks that a given image? Corresponds with a given digit. There's also a couple layers in between called the hidden layers Which for the time being?

need to motivate the relevance and importance of machine learning and neural networks to the present into the future","But what I want to do here is show you what a neural network actually is Assuming no background and to help visualize what a neural network's doing not as a buzzword but as a piece of math","My hope is just that you come away feeling like this structure","this structure itself is

and the following one is going to tackle learning What we're going to do is put together a neural network that can learn to recognize handwritten digits","This is a somewhat classic example for Introducing the topic","and I'm happy to stick with the status quo here because at the end of the two videos I want to point You to a couple good resources where you can learn more and where you can download the code that does this and play with it?","on your own computer There are many many variants of neural networks and in recent years","There's been sort of a boom in research towards these variants","But in these two introductory videos you and I are just going to look at the simplest plain-vanilla form with no added frills This is kind of a necessary prerequisite for understanding any of the more powerful modern variants and Trust me","it still has plenty of complexity for us to wrap our minds around But even in this simplest form it can learn to recognize handwritten digits Which is a pretty cool thing for a computer to be able to do.","And at the same time you'll see how it does fall short of a couple hopes that we might have for it As the name suggests neural networks are inspired by the brain, but let's break that down","What are the neurons and in what sense are they linked together?","Right now when I say neuron all I want you to think about","is a thing that holds a number Specifically a number between 0 & 1","it's really not more than that","For example the network starts with a bunch of neurons corresponding to each of the 28 times 28 pixels of the input image which is 784 neurons in total each one of these holds a number that represents the grayscale value of the corresponding pixel ranging from 0 for black pixels up to 1 for white pixels","This number inside the neuron is called its activation and the image you might have in mind here","Is that each neuron is lit up when its activation is a high number?","So all of these 784 neurons make up the first layer of our network Now jumping over to the last layer this has ten neurons each representing one of the digits the activation in these neurons again some number that's between zero and one Represents how much the system thinks that a given image?","Corresponds with a given digit.","There's also a couple layers in between called the hidden layers Which for the time being?","Should just be a giant question mark for how on earth","this process of recognizing digits is going to be handled In this network","I chose two hidden layers each one with 16 neurons and admittedly that's kind of an arbitrary choice to be honest","I chose two layers based on how I want to motivate the structure in just a moment and 16","well that was just a nice number to fit on the screen in practice","There is a lot of room for experiment with a specific structure here","The way the network operates activations in one layer determine the activations of the next layer And of course the heart of the network as an information processing mechanism comes down to exactly how those activations from one layer bring about activations in the next layer It's meant to be loosely analogous to how in biological networks of neurons some groups of neurons firing cause certain others to fire","Now the network I'm showing here has already been trained to recognize digits and let me show you what I mean by that It means if you feed in an image lighting up all 784 neurons of the input layer according to the brightness of each pixel in the image That pattern of activations causes some very specific pattern in the next layer Which causes some pattern in the one after it?","Which finally gives some pattern in the output layer and?","The brightest neuron of that output layer is the network's choice so to speak for what digit this image represents?","And before jumping into the math for how one layer influences the next or how training works?","Let's just talk about why it's even reasonable to expect a layered structure like this to behave intelligently What are we expecting here?","What is the best hope for what those middle layers might be doing?","Well when you or I recognize digits we piece together various components","a nine has a loop up top and a line on the right an 8 also has a loop up top, but it's paired with another loop down low A 4 basically breaks down into three specific lines and things like that","Now in a perfect world we might hope that each neuron in the second-to-last layer corresponds with one of these sub components That anytime you feed in an image with say a loop up top like a 9 or an 8","There's some specific Neuron whose activation is going to be close to one","and I don't mean this specific loop of pixels the hope would be that any Generally loopy pattern towards the top sets off this neuron that way going from the third layer to the last one just requires learning which combination of sub components corresponds to which digits Of course that just kicks the problem down the road Because how would you recognize these sub components or even learn what the right sub components should be","and I still haven't even talked about How one layer influences the next but run with me on this one for a moment recognizing a loop can also break down into subproblems One reasonable way to do this would be to first recognize the various little edges that make it up Similarly a long line like the kind you might see in the digits 1 or 4 or 7","Well that's really just a long edge or","maybe you think of it as a certain pattern of several smaller edges","So maybe our hope is that each neuron in the second layer of the network corresponds with the various relevant little edges Maybe when an image like this one comes in it lights up all of the neurons associated with around eight to ten specific little edges which in turn lights up the neurons associated with the upper loop and a long vertical line and Those light up the neuron associated with a nine whether or not This is what our final network actually does is another question, one that I'll come back to once","we see how to train the network","But this is a hope that we might have.","A sort of goal with the layered structure like this","Moreover you can imagine how being able to detect edges and patterns like this would be really useful for other image recognition tasks And even beyond image recognition there are all sorts of intelligent things you might want to do that break down into layers of abstraction Parsing speech for example involves taking raw audio and picking out distinct sounds which combine to make certain syllables Which combine to form words which combine to make up phrases and more abstract thoughts etc But getting back to how any of this actually works picture yourself right now designing How exactly the activations in one layer might determine the activations in the next?","The goal is to have some mechanism that could conceivably combine pixels into edges Or edges into patterns or patterns into digits and to zoom in on one very specific example","Let's say the hope is for one particular Neuron in the second layer to pick up on whether or not the image has an edge in this region here","The question at hand is what parameters should the network have what dials and knobs","should you be able to tweak so that it's expressive enough to potentially capture this pattern or Any other pixel pattern or the pattern that several edges can make a loop and other such things?","Well, what we'll do is assign a weight to each one of the connections between our neuron and the neurons from the first layer","These weights are just numbers then take all those activations from the first layer and compute their weighted sum according to these weights I Find it helpful to think of these weights as being organized into a little grid of their own","And I'm going to use green pixels to indicate positive weights and red pixels to indicate negative weights Where the brightness of that pixel is some loose depiction of the weights value?","Now if we made the weights associated with almost all of the pixels zero except for some positive weights in this region that we care about then taking the weighted sum of all the pixel values","really just amounts to adding up the values of the pixel just in the region that we care about","And, if you really want it to pick up on whether there's an edge here what you might do is have some negative weights associated with the surrounding pixels","Then the sum is largest when those middle pixels are bright, but the surrounding pixels are darker When you compute a weighted sum like this you might come out with any number but for this network what we want is for activations to be some value between 0 & 1 so a common thing to do is to pump this weighted sum Into some function that squishes the real number line into the range between 0 & 1 and","A common function that does this is called the sigmoid function also known as a logistic curve basically very negative inputs end up close","to zero very positive inputs end up close to 1 and it just steadily increases around the input 0","So the activation of the neuron here is basically a measure of how positive the relevant weighted sum is","But maybe it's not that you want the neuron to light up when the weighted sum is bigger than 0","Maybe you only want it to be active when the sum is bigger than say 10","That is you want some bias for it to be inactive what we'll do then","is just add in some other number like negative 10 to this weighted sum Before plugging it through the sigmoid squishification function That additional number is called the bias","So the weights tell you what pixel pattern this neuron in the second layer is picking up on and the bias tells you how high the weighted sum needs to be before the neuron starts getting meaningfully active","And that is just one neuron","Every other neuron in this layer is going to be connected to all 784 pixels neurons from the first layer and each one of those 784 connections has its own weight associated with it also","each one has some bias some other number that you add on to the weighted sum before squishing it with the sigmoid and That's a lot to think about with this hidden layer of 16 neurons that's a total of 784 times 16 weights along with 16 biases And","all of that is just the connections from the first layer to the second the connections between the other layers Also, have a bunch of weights and biases associated with them","All said and done this network has almost exactly 13,000 total weights and biases 13,000 knobs and dials that can be tweaked and turned to make this network behave in different ways","So when we talk about learning?","What that's referring to is getting the computer to find a valid setting for all of these many many numbers so that it'll actually solve the problem at hand","one thought Experiment that is at once fun and kind of horrifying is to imagine sitting down and setting all of these weights and biases by hand Purposefully tweaking the numbers so that the second layer picks up on edges the third layer picks up on patterns","etc","I personally find this satisfying rather than just reading the network as a total black box","Because when the network doesn't perform the way you anticipate if you've built up a little bit of a relationship with what those weights and biases actually mean you have a starting place for Experimenting with how to change the structure to improve or when the network does work?","But not for the reasons you might expect Digging into what the weights and biases are doing is a good way to challenge your assumptions and really expose the full space of possible solutions By the way the actual function here is a little cumbersome to write down.","Don't you think?","So let me show you a more notationally compact way that these connections are represented.","This is how you'd see it If you choose to read up more about neural networks Organize all of the activations from one layer into a column as a vector Then organize all of the weights as a matrix where each row of that matrix corresponds to the connections between one layer and a particular neuron in the next layer","What that means is that taking the weighted sum of the activations in the first layer according to these weights?","Corresponds to one of the terms in the matrix vector product of everything we have on the left here By the way","so much of machine learning just comes down to having a good grasp of linear algebra","So for any of you who want a nice visual understanding for matrices and what matrix vector multiplication means take a look at the series I did on linear algebra especially chapter three Back to our expression instead of talking about adding the bias to each one of these values","independently we represent it by Organizing all those biases into a vector and adding the entire vector to the previous matrix vector product Then as a final step I'll rap a sigmoid around the outside here","And what that's supposed to represent is that you're going to apply the sigmoid function to each specific component of the resulting vector inside","So once you write down this weight matrix and these vectors as their own symbols you can communicate the full transition of activations from one layer to the next in an extremely tight and neat little expression and This makes the relevant code both a lot simpler and a lot faster since many libraries optimize the heck out of matrix multiplication Remember how earlier I said these neurons are simply things that hold numbers","Well of course the specific numbers that they hold depends on the image you feed in","So it's actually more accurate to think of each neuron as a function one that takes in the outputs of all the neurons in the previous layer and spits out a number between zero and one","Really the entire network is just a function one that takes in 784 numbers as an input and spits out ten numbers as an output","It's an absurdly Complicated function one that involves thirteen thousand parameters in the forms of these weights and biases that pick up on certain patterns and which involves iterating many matrix vector products and the sigmoid squish evocation function","But it's just a function nonetheless and in a way it's kind of reassuring that it looks complicated","I mean if it were any simpler","what hope would we have that it could take on the challenge of recognizing digits?","And how does it take on that challenge?","How does this network learn the appropriate weights and biases just by looking at data?","Oh?","That's what I'll show in the next video, and I'll also dig a little more into what this particular network we are seeing is really doing Now","is the point I suppose I should say subscribe to stay notified about when that video or any new videos come out But realistically most of you don't actually receive notifications from YouTube, do you ?","Maybe more honestly I should say subscribe so that the neural networks that underlie YouTube's Recommendation algorithm are primed to believe that you want to see content from this channel get recommended to you anyway stay posted for more Thank you very much to everyone supporting these videos on patreon I've been a little slow to progress in the probability series this summer","But I'm jumping back into it after this project","so patrons you can look out for updates there To close things off here","I have with me","Lisha Li Lee who did her PhD work on the theoretical side of deep learning and who currently works at a venture capital firm called amplify partners Who kindly provided some of the funding for this video","so Lisha","one thing I think we should quickly bring up is this sigmoid function As I understand it early networks used this to squish the relevant weighted sum into that interval between zero and one You know kind of motivated by this biological analogy of neurons either being inactive or active (Lisha) -","Exactly (3B1B) -","But relatively few modern networks actually use sigmoid anymore.","That's kind of old school right ?","(Lisha)","-","Yeah or rather ReLU seems to be much easier to train (3B1B) -","And ReLU really stands for rectified linear unit (Lisha) -","Yes it's this kind of function where you're just taking a max of 0 and a where a is given by what you were explaining in the video and what this was sort of motivated from I think was a partially by a biological Analogy with how Neurons would either be activated or not","and so if it passes a certain threshold It would be the identity function","But if it did not then it would just not be activated so be zero","so it's kind of a simplification","Using sigmoids didn't help training, or it was very difficult to train","It's at some point and people just tried relu and it happened to work Very well for these incredibly Deep neural networks.","(3B1B) -","All right Thank You Lisha for background amplify partners in early-stage VC invests in technical

And at the same time you'll see how it does fall short of a couple hopes that we might have for it As the name suggests neural networks are inspired by the brain, but let's break that down What are the neurons and in what sense are they linked together? Right now when I say neuron all I want you to think about is a thing that holds a number Specifically a number between 0 & 1 it's really not more than that For example the network starts with a bunch of neurons corresponding to each of the 28 times 28 pixels of the input image which is 784 neurons in total each one of these holds a number that represents the grayscale value of the corresponding pixel ranging from 0 for black pixels up to 1 for white pixels This number inside the neuron is called its activation and the image you might have in mind here Is that each neuron is lit up when its activation is a high number? So all of these 784 neurons make up the first layer of our network Now jumping over to the last layer this has ten neurons each representing one of the digits the activation in these neurons again some number that's between zero and one Represents how much the system thinks that a given image? Corresponds with a given digit. There's also a couple layers in between called the hidden layers Which for the time being? Should just be a giant question mark for how on earth this process of recognizing digits is going to be handled In this network I chose two hidden layers each one with 16 neurons and admittedly that's kind of an arbitrary choice to be honest I chose two layers based on how I want to motivate the structure in just a moment and 16 well that was just a nice number to fit on the screen in practice There is a lot of room for experiment with a specific structure here The way the network operates activations in one layer determine the activations of the next layer And of course the heart of the network as an information processing mechanism comes down to exactly how those activations from one layer bring about activations in the next layer It's meant to be loosely analogous to how in biological networks of neurons some groups of neurons firing cause certain others to fire Now the network I'm showing here has already been trained to recognize digits and let me show you what I mean by that It means if you feed in an image lighting up all 784 neurons of the input layer according to the brightness of each pixel in the image That pattern of activations causes some very specific pattern in the next layer Which causes some pattern in the one after it? Which finally gives some pattern in the output layer and? The brightest neuron of that output layer is the network's choice so to speak for what digit this image represents? And before jumping into the math for how one layer influences the next or how training works? Let's just talk about why it's even reasonable to expect a layered structure like this to behave intelligently What are we expecting here? What is the best hope for what those middle layers might be doing? Well when you or I recognize digits we piece together various components a nine has a loop up top and a line on the right an 8 also has a loop up top, but it's paired with another loop down low A 4 basically breaks down into three specific lines and things like that Now in a perfect world we might hope that each neuron in the second-to-last layer corresponds with one of these sub components That anytime you feed in an image with say a loop up top like a 9 or an 8 There's some specific Neuron whose activation is going to be close to one and I don't mean this specific loop of pixels the hope would be that any Generally loopy pattern towards the top sets off this neuron that way going from the third layer to the last one just requires learning which combination of sub components corresponds to which digits Of course that just kicks the problem down the road Because how would you recognize these sub components or even learn what the right sub components should be and I still haven't even talked about How one layer influences the next but run with me on this one for a moment recognizing a loop can also break down into subproblems One reasonable way to do this would be to first recognize the various little edges that make it up Similarly a long line like the kind you might see in the digits 1 or 4 or 7 Well that's really just a long edge or maybe you think of it as a certain pattern of several smaller edges So maybe our hope is that each neuron in the second layer of the network corresponds with the various relevant little edges Maybe when an image like this one comes in it lights up all of the neurons associated with around eight to ten specific little edges which in turn lights up the neurons associated with the upper loop and a long vertical line and Those light up the neuron associated with a nine whether or not This is what our final network actually does is another question, one that I'll come back to once we see how to train the network But this is a hope that we might have. A sort of goal with the layered structure like this Moreover you can imagine how being able to detect edges and patterns like this would be really useful for other image recognition tasks And even beyond image recognition there are all sorts of intelligent things you might want to do that break down into layers of abstraction Parsing speech for example involves taking raw audio and picking out distinct sounds which combine to make certain syllables Which combine to form words which combine to make up phrases and more abstract thoughts etc But getting back to how any of this actually works picture yourself right now designing How exactly the activations in one layer might determine the activations in the next? The goal is to have some mechanism that could conceivably combine pixels into edges Or edges into patterns or patterns into digits and to zoom in on one very specific example Let's say the hope is for one particular Neuron in the second layer to pick up on whether or not the image has an edge in this region here The question at hand is what parameters should the network have what dials and knobs should you be able to tweak so that it's expressive enough to potentially capture this pattern or Any other pixel pattern or the pattern that several edges can make a loop and other such things? Well, what we'll do is assign a weight to each one of the connections between our neuron and the neurons from the first layer These weights are just numbers then take all those activations from the first layer and compute their weighted sum according to these weights I Find it helpful to think of these weights as being organized into a little grid of their own And I'm going to use green pixels to indicate positive weights and red pixels to indicate negative weights Where the brightness of that pixel is some loose depiction of the weights value? Now if we made the weights associated with almost all of the pixels zero except for some positive weights in this region that we care about then taking the weighted sum of all the pixel values really just amounts to adding up the values of the pixel just in the region that we care about And, if you really want it to pick up on whether there's an edge here what you might do is have some negative weights associated with the surrounding pixels Then the sum is largest when those middle pixels are bright, but the surrounding pixels are darker When you compute a weighted sum like this you might come out with any number but for this network what we want is for activations to be some value between 0 & 1 so a common thing to do is to pump this weighted sum Into some function that squishes the real number line into the range between 0 & 1 and A common function that does this is called the sigmoid function also known as a logistic curve basically very negative inputs end up close to zero very positive inputs end up close to 1 and it just steadily increases around the input 0 So the activation of the neuron here is basically a measure of how positive the relevant weighted sum is But maybe it's not that you want the neuron to light up when the weighted sum is bigger than 0 Maybe you only want it to be active when the sum is bigger than say 10 That is you want some bias for it to be inactive what we'll do then is just add in some other number like negative 10 to this weighted sum Before plugging it through the sigmoid squishification function That additional number is called the bias So the weights tell you what pixel pattern this neuron in the second layer is picking up on and the bias tells you how high the weighted sum needs to be before the neuron starts getting meaningfully active And that is just one neuron Every other neuron in this layer is going to be connected to all 784 pixels neurons from the first layer and each one of those 784 connections has its own weight associated with it also each one has some bias some other number that you add on to the weighted sum before squishing it with the sigmoid and That's a lot to think about with this hidden layer of 16 neurons that's a total of 784 times 16 weights along with 16 biases And all of that is just the connections from the first layer to the second the connections between the other layers Also, have a bunch of weights and biases associated with them All said and done this network has almost exactly 13,000 total weights and biases 13,000 knobs and dials that can be tweaked and turned to make this network behave in different ways So when we talk about learning? What that's referring to is getting the computer to find a valid setting for all of these many many numbers so that it'll actually solve the problem at hand one thought Experiment that is at once fun and kind of horrifying is to imagine sitting down and setting all of these weights and biases by hand Purposefully tweaking the numbers so that the second layer picks up on edges the third layer picks up on patterns etc I personally find this satisfying rather than just reading the network as a total black box Because when the network doesn't perform the way you anticipate if you've built up a little bit of a relationship with what those weights and biases actually mean you have a starting place for Experimenting with how to change the structure to improve or when the network does work? But not for the reasons you might expect Digging into what the weights and biases are doing is a good way to challenge your assumptions and really expose the full space of possible solutions By the way the actual function here is a little cumbersome to write down. Don't you think? So let me show you a more notationally compact way that these connections are represented. This is how you'd see it If you choose to read up more about neural networks Organize all of the activations from one layer into a column as a vector Then organize all of the weights as a matrix where each row of that matrix corresponds to the connections between one layer and a particular neuron in the next layer What that means is that taking the weighted sum of the activations in the first layer according to these weights? Corresponds to one of the terms in the matrix vector product of everything we have on the left here By the way so much of machine learning just comes down to having a good grasp of linear algebra So for any of you who want a nice visual understanding for matrices and what matrix vector multiplication means take a look at the series I did on linear algebra especially chapter three Back to our expression instead of talking about adding the bias to each one of these values independently we represent it by Organizing all those biases into a vector and adding the entire vector to the previous matrix vector product Then as a final step I'll rap a sigmoid around the outside here And what that's supposed to represent is that you're going to apply the sigmoid function to each specific component of the resulting vector inside So once you write down this weight matrix and these vectors as their own symbols you can communicate the full transition of activations from one layer to the next in an extremely tight and neat little expression and This makes the relevant code both a lot simpler and a lot faster since many libraries optimize the heck out of matrix multiplication Remember how earlier I said these neurons are simply things that hold numbers Well of course the specific numbers that they hold depends on the image you feed in So it's actually more accurate to think of each neuron as a function one that takes in the outputs of all the neurons in the previous layer and spits out a number between zero and one Really the entire network is just a function one that takes in 784 numbers as an input and spits out ten numbers as an output It's an absurdly Complicated function one that involves thirteen thousand parameters in the forms of these weights and biases that pick up on certain patterns and which involves iterating many matrix vector products and the sigmoid squish evocation function But it's just a function nonetheless and in a way it's kind of reassuring that it looks complicated I mean if it were any simpler what hope would we have that it could take on the challenge of recognizing digits? And how does it take on that challenge? How does this network learn the appropriate weights and biases just by looking at data? Oh?

a single number between 0 and 10 telling you what it thinks the digit is Well the task goes from comically trivial to dauntingly difficult Unless you've been living under a rock","I think I hardly need to motivate the relevance and importance of machine learning and neural networks to the present into the future","But what I want to do here is show you what a neural network actually is Assuming no background and to help visualize what a neural network's doing not as a buzzword but as a piece of math","My hope is just that you come away feeling like this structure","this structure itself is Motivated and to feel like you know what it means when you read or you hear about a neural network quote-unquote","learning This video is just going to be devoted to the structure component of that and the following one is going to tackle learning What we're going to do is put together a neural network that can learn to recognize handwritten digits","This is a somewhat classic example for Introducing the topic","and I'm happy to stick with the status quo here because at the end of the two videos I want to point You to a couple good resources where you can learn more and where you can download the code that does this and play with it?","on your own computer There are many many variants of neural networks and in recent years","There's been sort of a boom in research towards these variants","But in these two introductory videos you and I are just going to look at the simplest plain-vanilla form with no added frills This is kind of a necessary prerequisite for understanding any of the more powerful modern variants and Trust me","it still has plenty of complexity for us to wrap our minds around But even in this simplest form it can learn to recognize handwritten digits Which is a pretty cool thing for a computer to be able to do.","And at the same time you'll see how it does fall short of a couple hopes that we might have for it As the name suggests neural networks are inspired by the brain, but let's break that down","What are the neurons and in what sense are they linked together?","Right now when I say neuron all I want you to think about","is a thing that holds a number Specifically a number between 0 & 1","it's really not more than that","For example the network starts with a bunch of neurons corresponding to each of the 28 times 28 pixels of the input image which is 784 neurons in total each one of these holds a number that represents the grayscale value of the corresponding pixel ranging from 0 for black pixels up to 1 for white pixels","This number inside the neuron is called its activation and the image you might have in mind here","Is that each neuron is lit up when its activation is a high number?","So all of these 784 neurons make up the first layer of our network Now jumping over to the last layer this has ten neurons each representing one of the digits the activation in these neurons again some number that's between zero and one Represents how much the system thinks that a given image?","Corresponds with a given digit.","There's also a couple layers in between called the hidden layers Which for the time being?","Should just be a giant question mark for how on earth","this process of recognizing digits is going to be handled In this network","I chose two hidden layers each one with 16 neurons and admittedly that's kind of an arbitrary choice to be honest","I chose two layers based on how I want to motivate the structure in just a moment and 16","well that was just a nice number to fit on the screen in practice","There is a lot of room for experiment with a specific structure here","The way the network operates activations in one layer determine the activations of the next layer And of course the heart of the network as an information processing mechanism comes down to exactly how those activations from one layer bring about activations in the next layer It's meant to be loosely analogous to how in biological networks of neurons some groups of neurons firing cause certain others to fire","Now the network I'm showing here has already been trained to recognize digits and let me show you what I mean by that It means if you feed in an image lighting up all 784 neurons of the input layer according to the brightness of each pixel in the image That pattern of activations causes some very specific pattern in the next layer Which causes some pattern in the one after it?","Which finally gives some pattern in the output layer and?","The brightest neuron of that output layer is the network's choice so to speak for what digit this image represents?","And before jumping into the math for how one layer influences the next or how training works?","Let's just talk about why it's even reasonable to expect a layered structure like this to behave intelligently What are we expecting here?","What is the best hope for what those middle layers might be doing?","Well when you or I recognize digits we piece together various components","a nine has a loop up top and a line on the right an 8 also has a loop up top, but it's paired with another loop down low A 4 basically breaks down into three specific lines and things like that","Now in a perfect world we might hope that each neuron in the second-to-last layer corresponds with one of these sub components That anytime you feed in an image with say a loop up top like a 9 or an 8","There's some specific Neuron whose activation is going to be close to one","and I don't mean this specific loop of pixels the hope would be that any Generally loopy pattern towards the top sets off this neuron that way going from the third layer to the last one just requires learning which combination of sub components corresponds to which digits Of course that just kicks the problem down the road Because how would you recognize these sub components or even learn what the right sub components should be","and I still haven't even talked about How one layer influences the next but run with me on this one for a moment recognizing a loop can also break down into subproblems One reasonable way to do this would be to first recognize the various little edges that make it up Similarly a long line like the kind you might see in the digits 1 or 4 or 7","Well that's really just a long edge or","maybe you think of it as a certain pattern of several smaller edges","So maybe our hope is that each neuron in the second layer of the network corresponds with the various relevant little edges Maybe when an image like this one comes in it lights up all of the neurons associated with around eight to ten specific little edges which in turn lights up the neurons associated with the upper loop and a long vertical line and Those light up the neuron associated with a nine whether or not This is what our final network actually does is another question, one that I'll come back to once","we see how to train the network","But this is a hope that we might have.","A sort of goal with the layered structure like this","Moreover you can imagine how being able to detect edges and patterns like this would be really useful for other image recognition tasks And even beyond image recognition there are all sorts of intelligent things you might want to do that break down into layers of abstraction Parsing speech for example involves taking raw audio and picking out distinct sounds which combine to make certain syllables Which combine to form words which combine to make up phrases and more abstract thoughts etc But getting back to how any of this actually works picture yourself right now designing How exactly the activations in one layer might determine the activations in the next?","The goal is to have some mechanism that could conceivably combine pixels into edges Or edges into patterns or patterns into digits and to zoom in on one very specific example","Let's say the hope is for one particular Neuron in the second layer to pick up on whether or not the image has an edge in this region here","The question at hand is what parameters should the network have what dials and knobs","should you be able to tweak so that it's expressive enough to potentially capture this pattern or Any other pixel pattern or the pattern that several edges can make a loop and other such things?","Well, what we'll do is assign a weight to each one of the connections between our neuron and the neurons from the first layer","These weights are just numbers then take all those activations from the first layer and compute their weighted sum according to these weights I Find it helpful to think of these weights as being organized into a little grid of their own","And I'm going to use green pixels to indicate positive weights and red pixels to indicate negative weights Where the brightness of that pixel is some loose depiction of the weights value?","Now if we made the weights associated with almost all of the pixels zero except for some positive weights in this region that we care about then taking the weighted sum of all the pixel values","really just amounts to adding up the values of the pixel just in the region that we care about","And, if you really want it to pick up on whether there's an edge here what you might do is have some negative weights associated with the surrounding pixels","Then the sum is largest when those middle pixels are bright, but the surrounding pixels are darker When you compute a weighted sum like this you might come out with any number but for this network what we want is for activations to be some value between 0 & 1 so a common thing to do is to pump this weighted sum Into some function that squishes the real number line into the range between 0 & 1 and","A common function that does this is called the sigmoid function also known as a logistic curve basically very negative inputs end up close","to zero very positive inputs end up close to 1 and it just steadily increases around the input 0","So the activation of the neuron here is basically a measure of how positive the relevant weighted sum is","But maybe it's not that you want the neuron to light up when the weighted sum is bigger than 0","Maybe you only want it to be active when the sum is bigger than say 10","That is you want some bias for it to be inactive what we'll do then","is just add in some other number like negative 10 to this weighted sum Before plugging it through the sigmoid squishification function That additional number is called the bias","So the weights tell you what pixel pattern this neuron in the second layer is picking up on and the bias tells you how high the weighted sum needs to be before the neuron starts getting meaningfully active","And that is just one neuron","Every other neuron in this layer is going to be connected to all 784 pixels neurons from the first layer and each one of those 784 connections has its own weight associated with it also","each one has some bias some other number that you add on to the weighted sum before squishing it with the sigmoid and That's a lot to think about with this hidden layer of 16 neurons that's a total of 784 times 16 weights along with 16 biases And","all of that is just the connections from the first layer to the second the connections between the other layers Also, have a bunch of weights and biases associated with them","All said and done this network has almost exactly 13,000 total weights and biases 13,000 knobs and dials that can be tweaked and turned to make this network behave in different ways","So when we talk about learning?","What that's referring to is getting the computer to find a valid setting for all of these many many numbers so that it'll actually solve the problem at hand","one thought Experiment that is at once fun and kind of horrifying is to imagine sitting down and setting all of these weights and biases by hand Purposefully tweaking the numbers so that the second layer picks up on edges the third layer picks up on patterns","etc","I personally find this satisfying rather than just reading the network as a total black box","Because when the network doesn't perform the way you anticipate if you've built up a little bit of a relationship with what those weights and biases actually mean you have a starting place for Experimenting with how to change the structure to improve or when the network does work?","But not for the reasons you might expect Digging into what the weights and biases are doing is a good way to challenge your assumptions and really expose the full space of possible solutions By the way the actual function here is a little cumbersome to write down.","Don't you think?","So let me show you a more notationally compact way that these connections are represented.","This is how you'd see it If you choose to read up more about neural networks Organize all of the activations from one layer into a column as a vector Then organize all of the weights as a matrix where each row of that matrix corresponds to the connections between one layer and a particular neuron in the next layer","What that means is that taking the weighted sum of the activations in the first layer according to these weights?","Corresponds to one of the terms in the matrix vector product of everything we have on the left here By the way","so much of machine learning just comes down to having a good grasp of linear algebra","So for any of you who want a nice visual understanding for matrices and what matrix vector multiplication means take a look at the series I did on linear algebra especially chapter three Back to our expression instead of talking about adding the bias to each one of these values","independently we represent it by Organizing all those biases into a vector and adding the entire vector to the previous matrix vector product Then as a final step I'll rap a sigmoid around the outside here","And what that's supposed

that involves thirteen thousand parameters in the forms of these weights and biases that pick up on certain patterns and which involves iterating many matrix vector products and the sigmoid squish evocation function","But it's just a function nonetheless and in a way it's kind of reassuring that it looks complicated","I mean if it were any simpler","what hope would we have that it could take on the challenge of recognizing digits?","And how does it take on that challenge?","How does this network learn the appropriate weights and biases just by looking at data?","Oh?","That's what I'll show in the next video, and I'll also dig a little more into what this particular network we are seeing is really doing Now","is the point I suppose I should say subscribe to stay notified about when that video or any new videos come out But realistically most of you don't actually receive notifications from YouTube, do you ?","Maybe more honestly I should say subscribe so that the neural networks that

ERROR:root:api_check 0:00:00.367145
ERROR:root:payload: "This is a three. It's sloppily written and rendered at an extremely low resolution of 28 by 28 pixels. But your brain has no trouble recognizing it as a three and I want you to take a moment to appreciate How crazy it is that brains can do this so effortlessly? I mean this this and this are also recognizable as threes, even though the specific values of each pixel is very different from one image to the next. The particular light-sensitive cells in your eye that are firing when you see this three are very different from the ones firing when you see this three. But something in that crazy smart visual cortex of yours resolves these as representing the same idea while at the same time recognizing other images as their own distinct ideas But if I told you hey sit down and write for me a program that takes in a grid of 28 by 28 pixels like this and outputs a single number between 0 and 10 telling you what it thinks the digit is Well the task goes from comically trivial to dauntingly difficult Unless you've been living under a rock I think I hardly need to motivate the relevance and importance of machine learning and neural networks to the present into the future But what I want to do here is show you what a neural network actually is Assuming no background and to help visualize what it's doing not as a buzzword but as a piece of math My hope is just that you come away feeling like this structure itself is Motivated and to feel like you know what it means when you read or you hear about a neural network quote-unquote learning This video is just going to be devoted to the structure component of that and the following one is going to tackle learning What we're going to do is put together a neural network that can learn to recognize handwritten digits This is a somewhat classic example for Introducing the topic and I'm happy to stick with the status quo here because at the end of the two videos I want to point You to a couple good resources where you can learn more and where you can download the code that does this and play with it? on your own computer There are many many variants of neural networks and in recent years There's been sort of a boom in research towards these variants But in these two introductory videos you and I are just going to look at the simplest plain-vanilla form with no added frills This is kind of a necessary prerequisite for understanding any of the more powerful modern variants and Trust me it still has plenty of complexity for us to wrap our minds around But even in this simplest form it can learn to recognize handwritten digits Which is a pretty cool thing for a computer to be able to do. And at the same time you'll see how it does fall short of a couple hopes that we might have for it As the name suggests neural networks are inspired by the brain, but let's break that down What are the neurons and in what sense are they linked together? Right now when I say neuron all I want you to think about is a thing that holds a number Specifically a number between 0 & 1 it's really not more than that For example the network starts with a bunch of neurons corresponding to each of the 28 times 28 pixels of the input image which is 784 neurons in total each one of these holds a number that represents the grayscale value of the corresponding pixel ranging from 0 for black pixels up to 1 for white pixels This number inside the neuron is called its activation and the image you might have in mind here Is that each neuron is lit up when its activation is a high number? So all of these 784 neurons make up the first layer of our network Now jumping over to the last layer this has ten neurons each representing one of the digits the activation in these neurons again some number that's between zero and one Represents how much the system thinks that a given image? Corresponds with a given digit. There's also a couple layers in between called the hidden layers Which for the time being? Should just be a giant question mark for how on earth this process of recognizing digits is going to be handled In this network I chose two hidden layers each one with 16 neurons and admittedly that's kind of an arbitrary choice to be honest I chose two layers based on how I want to motivate the structure in just a moment and 16 well that was just a nice number to fit on the screen in practice There is a lot of room for experiment with a specific structure here The way the network operates activations in one layer determine the activations of the next layer And of course the heart of the network as an information processing mechanism comes down to exactly how those activations from one layer bring about activations in the next layer It's meant to be loosely analogous to how in biological networks of neurons some groups of neurons firing cause certain others to fire Now the network I'm showing here has already been trained to recognize digits and let me show you what I mean by that It means if you feed in an image lighting up all 784 neurons of the input layer according to the brightness of each pixel in the image That pattern of activations causes some very specific pattern in the next layer Which causes some pattern in the one after it? Which finally gives some pattern in the output layer and? The brightest neuron of that output layer is the network's choice so to speak for what digit this image represents? And before jumping into the math for how one layer influences the next or how training works? Let's just talk about why it's even reasonable to expect a layered structure like this to behave intelligently What are we expecting here? What is the best hope for what those middle layers might be doing? Well when you or I recognize digits we piece together various components a nine has a loop up top and a line on the right an 8 also has a loop up top, but it's paired with another loop down low A 4 basically breaks down into three specific lines and things like that Now in a perfect world we might hope that each neuron in the second-to-last layer corresponds with one of these sub components That anytime you feed in an image with say a loop up top like a 9 or an 8 There's some specific Neuron whose activation is going to be close to one and I don't mean this specific loop of pixels the hope would be that any Generally loopy pattern towards the top sets off this neuron that way going from the third layer to the last one just requires learning which combination of sub components corresponds to which digits Of course that just kicks the problem down the road Because how would you recognize these sub components or even learn what the right sub components should be and I still haven't even talked about How one layer influences the next but run with me on this one for a moment recognizing a loop can also break down into subproblems One reasonable way to do this would be to first recognize the various little edges that make it up Similarly a long line like the kind you might see in the digits 1 or 4 or 7 Well that's really just a long edge or maybe you think of it as a certain pattern of several smaller edges So maybe our hope is that each neuron in the second layer of the network corresponds with the various relevant little edges Maybe when an image like this one comes in it lights up all of the neurons associated with around eight to ten specific little edges which in turn lights up the neurons associated with the upper loop and a long vertical line and Those light up the neuron associated with a nine whether or not This is what our final network actually does is another question, one that I'll come back to once we see how to train the network But this is a hope that we might have. A sort of goal with the layered structure like this Moreover you can imagine how being able to detect edges and patterns like this would be really useful for other image recognition tasks And even beyond image recognition there are all sorts of intelligent things you might want to do that break down into layers of abstraction Parsing speech for example involves taking raw audio and picking out distinct sounds which combine to make certain syllables Which combine to form words which combine to make up phrases and more abstract thoughts etc But getting back to how any of this actually works picture yourself right now designing How exactly the activations in one layer might determine the activations in the next? The goal is to have some mechanism that could conceivably combine pixels into edges Or edges into patterns or patterns into digits and to zoom in on one very specific example Let's say the hope is for one particular Neuron in the second layer to pick up on whether or not the image has an edge in this region here The question at hand is what parameters should the network have what dials and knobs should you be able to tweak so that it's expressive enough to potentially capture this pattern or Any other pixel pattern or the pattern that several edges can make a loop and other such things? Well, what we'll do is assign a weight to each one of the connections between our neuron and the neurons from the first layer These weights are just numbers then take all those activations from the first layer and compute their weighted sum according to these weights I Find it helpful to think of these weights as being organized into a little grid of their own And I'm going to use green pixels to indicate positive weights and red pixels to indicate negative weights Where the brightness of that pixel is some loose depiction of the weights value? Now if we made the weights associated with almost all of the pixels zero except for some positive weights in this region that we care about then taking the weighted sum of all the pixel values really just amounts to adding up the values of the pixel just in the region that we care about And, if you really want it to pick up on whether there's an edge here what you might do is have some negative weights associated with the surrounding pixels Then the sum is largest when those middle pixels are bright, but the surrounding pixels are darker When you compute a weighted sum like this you might come out with any number but for this network what we want is for activations to be some value between 0 & 1 so a common thing to do is to pump this weighted sum Into some function that squishes the real number line into the range between 0 & 1 and A common function that does this is called the sigmoid function also known as a logistic curve basically very negative inputs end up close to zero very positive inputs end up close to 1 and it just steadily increases around the input 0 So the activation of the neuron here is basically a measure of how positive the relevant weighted sum is But maybe it's not that you want the neuron to light up when the weighted sum is bigger than 0 Maybe you only want it to be active when the sum is bigger than say 10 That is you want some bias for it to be inactive what we'll do then is just add in some other number like negative 10 to this weighted sum Before plugging it through the sigmoid squishification function That additional number is called the bias So the weights tell you what pixel pattern this neuron in the second layer is picking up on and the bias tells you how high the weighted sum needs to be before the neuron starts getting meaningfully active And that is just one neuron Every other neuron in this layer is going to be connected to all 784 pixels neurons from the first layer and each one of those 784 connections has its own weight associated with it also each one has some bias some other number that you add on to the weighted sum before squishing it with the sigmoid and That's a lot to think about with this hidden layer of 16 neurons that's a total of 784 times 16 weights along with 16 biases And all of that is just the connections from the first layer to the second the connections between the other layers Also, have a bunch of weights and biases associated with them All said and done this network has almost exactly 13,000 total weights and biases 13,000 knobs and dials that can be tweaked and turned to make this network behave in different ways So when we talk about learning? What that's referring to is getting the computer to find a valid setting for all of these many many numbers so that it'll actually solve the problem at hand one thought Experiment that is at once fun and kind of horrifying is to imagine sitting down and setting all of these weights and biases by hand Purposefully tweaking the numbers so that the second layer picks up on edges the third layer picks up on patterns etc I personally find this satisfying rather than just reading the network as a total black box Because when the network doesn't perform the way you anticipate if you've built up a little bit of a relationship with what those weights and biases actually mean you have a starting place for Experimenting with how to change the structure to improve or when the network does work? But not for the reasons you might expect Digging into what the weights and biases are doing is a good way to challenge your assumptions and really expose the full space of possible solutions By the way the actual function here is a little cumbersome to write down. Don't you think? So let me show you a more notationally compact way that these connections are represented. This is how you'd see it If you choose to read up more about neural networks Organize all of the activations from one layer into a column as a vector Then organize all of the weights as a matrix where each row of that matrix corresponds to the connections between one layer and a particular neuron in the next layer What that means is that taking the weighted sum of the activations in the first layer according to these weights? Corresponds to one of the terms in the matrix vector product of everything we have on the left here By the way so much of machine learning just comes down to having a good grasp of linear algebra So for any of you who want a nice visual understanding for matrices and what matrix vector multiplication means take a look at the series I did on linear algebra especially chapter three Back to our expression instead of talking about adding the bias to each one of these values independently we represent it by Organizing all those biases into a vector and adding the entire vector to the previous matrix vector product Then as a final step I'll rap a sigmoid around the outside here And what that's supposed to represent is that you're going to apply the sigmoid function to each specific component of the resulting vector inside So once you write down this weight matrix and these vectors as their own symbols you can communicate the full transition of activations from one layer to the next in an extremely tight and neat little expression and This makes the relevant code both a lot simpler and a lot faster since many libraries optimize the heck out of matrix multiplication Remember how earlier I said these neurons are simply things that hold numbers Well of course the specific numbers that they hold depends on the image you feed in So it's actually more accurate to think of each neuron as a function one that takes in the outputs of all the neurons in the previous layer and spits out a number between zero and one Really the entire network is just a function one that takes in 784 numbers as an input and spits out ten numbers as an output It's an absurdly Complicated function one that involves thirteen thousand parameters in the forms of these weights and biases that pick up on certain patterns and which involves iterating many matrix vector products and the sigmoid squish evocation function But it's just a function nonetheless and in a way it's kind of reassuring that it looks complicated I mean if it were any simpler what hope would we have that it could take on the challenge of recognizing digits? And how does it take on that challenge? How does this network learn the appropriate weights and biases just by looking at data? Oh? That's what I'll show in the next video, and I'll also dig a little more into what this particular network we are seeing is really doing Now is the point I suppose I should say subscribe to stay notified about when that video or any new videos come out But realistically most of you don't actually receive notifications from YouTube, do you ? Maybe more honestly I should say subscribe so that the neural networks that underlie YouTube's Recommendation algorithm are primed to believe that you want to see content from this channel get recommended to you anyway stay posted for more Thank you very much to everyone supporting these videos on patreon I've been a little slow to progress in the probability series this summer But I'm jumping back into it after this project so patrons you can look out for updates there To close things off here I have with me Lisha Li Lee who did her PhD work on the theoretical side of deep learning and who currently works at a venture capital firm called amplify partners Who kindly provided some of the funding for this video so Lisha one thing I think we should quickly bring up is this sigmoid function As I understand it early networks used this to squish the relevant weighted sum into that interval between zero and one You know kind of motivated by this biological analogy of neurons either being inactive or active (Lisha) - Exactly (3B1B) - But relatively few modern networks actually use sigmoid anymore. That's kind of old school right ? (Lisha) - Yeah or rather ReLU seems to be much easier to train (3B1B) - And ReLU really stands for rectified linear unit (Lisha) - Yes it's this kind of function where you're just taking a max of 0 and a where a is given by what you were explaining in the video and what this was sort of motivated from I think was a partially by a biological Analogy with how Neurons would either be activated or not and so if it passes a certain threshold It would be the identity function But if it did not then it would just not be activated so be zero so it's kind of a simplification Using sigmoids didn't help training, or it was very difficult to train It's at some point and people just tried relu and it happened to work Very well for these incredibly Deep neural networks. (3B1B) - All right Thank You Lisha for background amplify partners in early-stage VC invests in technical founders building the next generation of companies focused on the applications of AI if you or someone that you know has ever thought about starting a company someday Or if you're working on an early-stage one right now the Amplify folks would love to hear from you they even set up a specific email for this video 3blue1brown@amplifypartners.com so feel free to reach out to them through that"

This is how you'd see it If you choose to read up more about neural networks Organize all of the activations from one layer into a column as a vector Then organize all of the weights as a matrix where each row of that matrix corresponds to the connections between one layer and a particular neuron in the next layer What that means is that taking the weighted sum of the activations in the first layer according to these weights? Corresponds to one of the terms in the matrix vector product of everything we have on the left here By the way so much of machine learning just comes down to having a good grasp of linear algebra So for any of you who want a nice visual understanding for matrices and what matrix vector multiplication means take a look at the series I did on linear algebra especially chapter three Back to our expression instead of talking about adding the bias to each one of these values independently we represent it by Organizing all those biases into a vector and adding the entire vector to the previous matrix vector product Then as a final step I'll rap a sigmoid around the outside here And what that's supposed to represent is that you're going to apply the sigmoid function to each specific component of the resulting vector inside So once you write down this weight matrix and these vectors as their own symbols you can communicate the full transition of activations from one layer to the next in an extremely tight and neat little expression and This makes the relevant code both a lot simpler and a lot faster since many libraries optimize the heck out of matrix multiplication Remember how earlier I said these neurons are simply things that hold numbers Well of course the specific numbers that they hold depends on the image you feed in So it's actually more accurate to think of each neuron as a function one that takes in the outputs of all the neurons in the previous layer and spits out a number between zero and one Really the entire network is just a function one that takes in 784 numbers as an input and spits out ten numbers as an output It's an absurdly Complicated function one that involves thirteen thousand parameters in the forms of these weights and biases that pick up on certain patterns and which involves iterating many matrix vector products and the sigmoid squish evocation function But it's just a function nonetheless and in a way it's kind of reassuring that it looks complicated I mean if it were any simpler what hope would we have that it could take on the challenge of recognizing digits?

an arbitrary choice to be honest","I chose two layers based on how I want to motivate the structure in just a moment and 16","well that was just a nice number to fit on the screen in practice","There is a lot of room for experiment with a specific structure here","The way the network operates activations in one layer determine the activations of the next layer And of course the heart of the

mean by that It means if you feed in an image lighting up all 784 neurons of the input layer according to the brightness of each pixel in the image That pattern of activations causes some very specific pattern in the next layer Which causes some pattern in the one after it?","Which finally gives some pattern in the output layer and?","The brightest neuron of that output layer is the network's choice so to speak for what digit this image represents?","And before jumping into the math for how one layer influences the next or how training works?","Let's just talk about why it's even reasonable to expect a layered structure like this to behave intelligently What are we expecting here?","What is the best hope for what those middle layers might be doing?","Well when you or I recognize digits we piece together various components","a nine has a loop up top and a line on the right an 8 also has a loop up top, but it's paired with another loop down low A 4 basically breaks down into three specific lines and things like that","Now in a perfect world we might hope that each neuron in the second-to-last layer corresponds with one of these sub components That anytime you

is a hope that we might have.","A sort of goal with the layered structure like this","Moreover you can imagine how being able to detect edges and patterns like this would be really useful for other image recognition tasks And even beyond image recognition there are all sorts of intelligent things you might want to do that break down into layers of abstraction Parsing speech for example involves taking raw audio and picking out distinct sounds which combine to make certain syllables Which combine to form words which combine to make up phrases and more abstract thoughts etc But getting back to how any of this actually works picture yourself right now designing How exactly the activations in one layer might determine the activations in the next?","The goal is to have some mechanism that could conceivably combine pixels into edges Or edges into patterns or patterns into digits and to zoom in on one very specific example","Let's say the hope is for one particular Neuron in the second layer to pick up on whether or not the image has an edge in this region here","The question at hand is what parameters should the network have what dials and knobs","should you be able to tweak so that it's expressive enough to potentially capture this pattern or Any other pixel pattern or the pattern that several edges can make a loop and other such things?","Well, what we'll do is assign a weight to each one of the connections between our neuron and the neurons from the first layer","These weights are just numbers then take all those activations from the first layer and compute their weighted sum according to these weights I Find it helpful to think of these weights as being organized into a little grid of their own","And I'm going to use green pixels to indicate positive weights

that we care about","And, if you really want it to pick up on whether there's an edge here what you might do is have some negative weights associated with the surrounding pixels","Then the sum is largest when those middle pixels are bright, but the surrounding pixels are darker When you compute a weighted sum like this you might come out with any number but for this network what we want is for

the weighted sum is bigger than 0","Maybe you only want it to be active when the sum is bigger than say 10","That is you want some bias for it to be inactive what we'll do then","is just add in some other number like negative 10 to this weighted sum Before plugging it through the sigmoid squishification function That additional number is called the bias","So the weights tell you what pixel pattern this neuron in the second layer is picking up on and the bias tells you how high the weighted sum needs to be before the neuron starts getting meaningfully active","And that is just one

ERROR:root:payload: 'World War II was the largest conflict in all of human history. The largest and bloodiest conflict And so you can imagine it is quite complex My goal in this video is to start giving us a survey, an overview of the war. And I won\'t even be able to cover it all in this video. It is really just a think about how did things get started. Or what happened in the lead up? And to start I am actually going to focus on Asia and the Pacific. Which probably doesn\'t get enough attention when we look at it from a western point of view But if we go back even to the early 1900s. Japan is becoming more and more militaristic. More and more nationalistic. In the early 1900s it had already occupied... It had already occupied Korea as of 1910. and in 1931 it invades Manchuria. It invades Manchuria. So this right over here, this is in 1931. And it installs a puppet state, the puppet state of Manchukuo. And when we call something a puppet state, it means that there is a government there. And they kind of pretend to be in charge. But they\'re really controlled like a puppet by someone else. And in this case it is the Empire of Japan. And we do remember what is happening in China in the 1930s. China is embroiled in a civil war. So there is a civil war going on in China. And that civil war is between the Nationalists, the Kuomintang and the Communists versus the Communists The Communists led by Mao Zedong. The Kuomintang led by general Chiang Kai-shek. And so they\'re in the midst of the civil war. So you can imagine Imperial Japan is taking advantage of this to take more and more control  over parts of China And that continues through the 30s until we get to 1937. And in 1937 the Japanese use some pretext with, you know, kind of a false flag, kind of... well, I won\'t go into the depths of what started it kind of this Marco-Polo Bridge Incident But it uses that as justifications to kind of have an all-out war with China so 1937...you have all-out war and this is often referred to as  the Second Sino-Japanese War ...Sino-Japanese War Many historians actually would even consider  this the beginning of World War II. While, some of them say, ok this is the beginning of the Asian Theater of World War II of the all-out war between Japan and China, but it isn\'t until Germany invades Poland  in 1939 that you truly have the formal beginning, so to speak, of World War II. Regardless of whether you consider this the formal beginning or not, the Second Sino-Japanese War, and it\'s called the second because there was another Sino-Japanese War in the late 1800s that was called the First Sino-Japanese War, this is incredibly, incredibly brutal and incredibly bloody a lot of civilians affected we could do a whole series of videos just on that But at this point it does become all-out war and this causes the civil war  to take a back seat to fighting off the aggressor  of Japan in 1937. So that lays a foundation for what\'s happening  in The Pacific, in the run-up to World War II. And now let\'s also remind ourselves  what\'s happening... what\'s happening in Europe. As we go through the 1930s Hitler\'s Germany, the Nazi Party, is getting more and more militaristic. So this is Nazi Germany... Nazi Germany right over here. They\'re allied with Benito Mussolini\'s Italy. They\'re both extremely nationalistic; they both do not like the Communists, at all You might remember, that in 1938... 1938, you have the Anschluss, which I\'m sure I\'m mispronouncing, and you also have the takeover  of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia. So the Anschluss was the unification with Austria and then you have the Germans taking over the of Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia and this is kind of the famous, you know, the rest of the, what will be called the Allied Powers kind of say, "Okay, yeah, okay maybe Hitler\'s  just going to just do that... well we don\'t want to start another war. We still all remember World War I; it was really horrible. And so they kind of appease Hitler and he\'s able to, kind of, satisfy his aggression. so in 1938 you have Austria, Austria and the Sudetenland ...and the Sudetenland... are taken over,  are taken over by Germany and then as you go into 1939, as you go into 1939 in March they\'re able to take over all of Czechoslovakia they\'re able to take over all of Czechoslovakia and once again the Allies are kind of, they\'re feeling very uncomfortable, they kind of, have seen something like this before they would like to push back, but they still are, kind of, are not feeling good  about starting another World War so they\'re hoping that maybe Germany stops there. So let me write this down... So all of Czechoslovakia... ...Czechoslovakia... is taken over by the Germans. This is in March of 1939. And then in August you have the Germans, and this is really in preparation for, what you could guess is about to happen, for the all-out war that\'s about to happen the Germans don\'t want to fight  the Soviets right out the gate, as we will see, and as you might know, they do eventually take on the Soviet Union, but in 1939 they get into a pact with  the Soviet Union. And so this is, they sign the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with the Soviet Union, this is in August, which is essentially  mutual non-aggression "Hey, you know, you do what you need to do, we know what we need to do." and they secretly started saying "Okay were gonna, all the countries out here, we\'re going to create these  spheres of influence where Germany can take, uh, control of part of it and the Soviet Union, and Stalin is in charge  of the Soviet Union at this point, can take over other parts of it. And then that leads us to the formal start where in September, let me write this in a different color... so September of 1939, on September 1st, Germany invades Poland Germany invades Poland on September 1st, which is generally considered  the beginning of World War II. and then you have the Great Britain and France declares war on Germany so let me write this World War II... starts everyone is declaring war on each other, Germany invades Poland, Great Britain and France  declare war on Germany, and you have to remember at this point Stalin isn\'t so concerned about Hitler he\'s just signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and so in mid-September, Stalin himself invades Poland as well so they both can kind of carve out... ...their spheres of influence... so you can definitely sense that things are  not looking good for the world at this point you already have Asia in the  Second Sino-Japanese War, incredibly bloody war, and now you have kind of, a lot of very similar actors  that you had in World War I and then they\'re starting to get into  a fairly extensive engagement.'

Momentum depends on the frame of reference, but in any inertial frame it is a conserved quantity, meaning that if a closed system is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum does not change. Momentum is also conserved in special relativity (with a modified formula) and, in a modified form, in electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and general relativity.

ERROR:root:payload: 'Hi I’m John Green and this is Crash Course European History. So, leading up to World War I, Germany had promised to back Austria-Hungary in any war, whether offensive or defensive, and armed with this so-called “blank check” of support, the Austro-Hungarian Habsburgs issued an ultimatum to Serbia, which the Habsburgs blamed for the assassination of their Archduke. Serbia accepted the harsh conditions except one--that Austria-Hungary would be allowed to participate in the investigation of the murder. “All reason for war is gone,” German Kaiser William II said. And yet Austria-Hungary and Germany—the Central Powers--both mobilized against Serbia by the end of July, eager to crush the pesky Serbs and believing that the war would be a local and contained one. It didn’t go that way. [Intro] In a swirl of military activity, Austria and Germany mobilized their armies while virtually simultaneously Russia came to the defense of its ally, Serbia. France mobilized to aid its ally Russia. The wild card was Britain, which Germany thought would not come to the aid of Britain’s frequent historical enemy France. And indeed, Britain did not immediately declare war, which was a good thing for the anglophile German Kaiser, who did not want to declare war on his cousin George, King of England, although he didn’t mind declaring war on his cousin Nicholas, czar of Russia. Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice hereditary succession. As discussed in our last episode, Europe was primed for all out war. By this time millions of young men had been trained in the conscription efforts of the past decades. And on the eve of full mobilization, a French nationalist assassinated Jean Jaures, who was a powerful socialist and pacifist working for peace--a potent example of the rise of violent nationalism. Already established plans for military mobilization were rolled out: Russia ordered full mobilization on July 29, 1914, just one day after Kaiser William said “All reason for war is gone.” In point of fact, the German General Staff had also quickly mobilized for war; these things could happen very fast now that military leaders had railroads and automobiles to quickly move troops, supplies, and auxiliary personnel. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble. [[TV-GERMANS IN FRANCE]] 1. Germany declared war on France on August 2, 2. following the Schlieffen Plan. 3. According to the plan, the main German military units would proceed through neutral Belgium 4. and descend through northern France to encircle Paris from the west. 5. Then, after quickly defeating France, 6. troops would be moved to the lightly defended eastern front 7. where the slow-to-mobilize Russian army would be quickly knocked out. 8. The war would be over by Christmas. 9. But the very first stage of that plan involved marching through Belgium unopposed, 10. which did not happen. 11. Indeed, millions of people would die on the western front in Belgium and France. 12. The Central Powers’ plan was complicated when the British joined France and Russia after Germany broke Belgium’s neutrality to get to France, 13. thus forming the so-called “Allied” partners of the war. 14. Also, the Russians mobilized much faster than many expected, 15. moving swiftly to assist their French ally 16. and as a result scored notable early victories against the Germans in East Prussia. 17. However, their generals were less able than their German counterparts 18. and did not follow up on those victories, 19. allowing the Germans to strike back effectively. 20. The Germans regrouped under Generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff, who demanded troops from the western front be brought to the eastern one. Thanks, Thought Bubble So, the war in the east became a nightmare not just for soldiers but also for civilians. Armies moved back and forth across east-central and central Europe, driving out, abusing, and killing civilian populations in the turmoil of conflict. On the western front, conditions were less mobile, settling into a grim pattern of trench warfare in which there was little movement and massive casualties. Because combatants all had access to heavy weaponry, including long-range artillery and machine guns, generals felt that the decisive factor in achieving victory was soldiers’ zeal and confident spirit in battle. They believed flashing sabers and lively marching, along with the “cult of the offensive” would carry their forces to victory. Basically, generals on all sides believed that a vigorous attack, rather than a good defense, would win the war. This meant that on the western front the leadership regularly prepared and executed massive attacks on enemy forces, which were extremely well-defended. During the battles of Verdun and the Somme, literally millions of shells were fired, making for millions of casualties and resulting only in stalemate. Soldiers were ordered out of their trenches to go “over the top” only to be mowed down by intense machine gun fire. Both the battles of the Verdun and Somme were intended as these dramatic and overwhelming efforts to definitively knock out the enemy, and both failed. In the trenches, British soldiers began to sing, “We’re here because we’re here because we’re here because we’re here,” to express their confusion and despair over not knowing why they were fighting or why they were being asked to go over the top. But still the generals ordered more attacks, which led to more casualties and little ground won or lost. The supply of young men to use in this way seemed limitless. The Central Powers benefited when the Ottoman Empire joined its side in October 1914, while Italy joined the Allies in 1915 after being promised major territorial gains upon victory. And combatants also enlisted soldiers from colonies and conscripted hundreds of thousands more to do menial labor. The French, for example, forced some 100,000 southeast Asians into the ranks of soldiers and menial workers, while approximately 1.5 million Indians served Britain, with 74,000 killed in battle. Many people in colonial armies on the western front were put into the very front ranks, meaning they would take the first machine gun fire. More than 2 million Asians and hundreds of thousands of Africans, in addition to Australians and New Zealanders fought on the many battlefields of World War I as the war moved into the Middle East, Africa, and East Asia. And this meant that life within these armies was often very diverse, with people from different villages, and nations, and even continents sharing life in the trenches. By encountering lots of different people, soldiers learned about other ways of living than had reached them in their mostly rural lives. This included many soldiers from colonies, who learned much about their colonizers’ technologies, and also about their barbarism. And some soldiers recreated domestic life in the trenches, observing teatime and attending to healing wounded or sick comrades. Early in the war especially, they also sometimes fraternized with the enemy--in the famous Christmas Truce of 1914, soldiers from both sides on the Western Front left their trenches and met in No Man’s Land, playing soccer, exchanging mementos, and serenading each other. “The Germans don’t want to fight any more than we do,” said one seasoned British soldier. But despite the fraternization, the trenches were largely hellish pits of corpses, filth and excrement. Forced marches passed not over solid roads but over pathways composed of dead bodies. New technology unfolded during the war, which added to the death count. Beginning in 1915 soldiers suffered blinding attacks from mustard, phosgene, chlorine, and other poisonous gases, developed in the rising chemical industry. Airplanes, picked up by the Europeans faster than the Americans, fought one another at close range with guns and began dropping bombs on cities. The fire power wielded by armies was so destructive that journalists were not allowed to photograph battlefield scenes, where mutilated and rotting corpses were strewn for miles and where limbs and other body parts hung, stuck in trees. But artists such as German soldier Otto Dix did seek to capture the soldier’s horror at the battlefield experience. We have a long history of romanticizing war in our culture, but World War I was horrible. The art historian Robert Hughes has written of the peculiarly modernist hell of repetition, and by that measure, and so many others, World War I was hell. Amidst the chaos and brutality of the war, ethnic cleansing flourished across eastern Europe as armies targeted Jews and Poles, to name just two groups. In the Ottoman Empire, Russians and their Armenian allies slaughtered entire Muslim villages, while the Central Powers slaughtered Armenians in a deadly back and forth. And then, in the spring of 1915, the Ottoman government ordered their troops to eradicate Armenians more systematically, leading to the torture and death of an estimated 600,000 to 1 million people. This wasn’t a response to a specific uprising of the Armenians; it was a genocide that deliberately aimed to eliminate as much of the Armenian population as possible. War at sea was also at a deadly stalemate--including the deployment of battleships and submarines on both sides. In 1917, the German general staff resumed submarine attacks on Allied shipping, after having stopped the practice for fear that the United States might enter the war on behalf of the Allied powers. And then that spring, the United States responded by entering the war on behalf of the Allied powers. But their participation was not militarily effective until 1918 because weapons needed to be manufactured and recruits needed to be called up, and trained, and transported to Europe. In the meantime, Europeans were innovating militarily, especially by developing a tactic of concentrated attack at a single point. This puncturing would allow the attacker to move behind enemy lines. But war-weariness was simultaneously bringing civilian uprisings, especially in Russia, mutinies, especially among the French; and even starvation in cities like Vienna. Spanish influenza, a variety of flu that often struck the young and healthy, was also beginning to attack troops. And yet amid all of this collapse, rulers firmly rejected peacemaking or even compromise. In 1915, a group of activist women visited heads of state with a peace plan, which was dismissed--but it did reappear in altered form as U.S. President Wilson’s Fourteen Points. But instead of peace, Kaiser William raged “Only in the ruins of London will I forgive Georgy.” (Georgy being his cousin King George V.) And political leader Georges Clemenceau of France called for a “war to the death.” When Habsburg Emperor Francis Joseph died in November 1916, his subjects were too weakened to mourn. But his successor Emperor Karl did eventually began to seek the war’s end, as did the German Reichstag in the summer of 1917. I know it’s not the time for a joke, but...Emperor Karl? Sometimes, even in the darkest days, history just offers up the most magnificent names All right, back to the war. Even as the politicians began to waver, military leadership remained determined. The Germans tried to puncture Allied lines in a spring 1918 offensive,but victory eluded them as the Allies brought out airplanes and tanks. And then, in the summer of 1918 the Allies, assisted now by American forces, drove the Central Powers eastward toward Germany. Casualties for the six months of German offensives reached two million as their army disintegrated. By January 1918 President Wilson had issued his aforementioned Fourteen Points, a set of principles on which peace should be based. As the war continued taking its grim toll, its end began to look plausible to many in the civilian leadership because Wilson called for a rational settlement rather than a revenge-driven surrender. By the autumn of 1918, not only were soldiers deserting the Central Powers, civilians across Germany were also in rebellion. And so eventually the leadership of Germany negotiated an armistice. On November 9, Kaiser William fled his empire, and on November 11 an armistice was signed. The war was over sorta. In the Habsburg Empire, the various ethnicities were declaring their independence, and Russians were mired in their revolution, which had broken out the previous spring. And the Ottoman Empire was still fighting and would continue to do so as Britain hoped to take over Constantinople with the help of its Greek, American and other allies. So the end of the War to End All Wars did not actually feature an end even to that war. The extent of the loss of human life in World War I is unknowable. But as historians dig into the evidence, it’s clear that deaths were far greater than initially calculated. Only now are historians paying enough attention to the war on the eastern front in large part because the victors wrote the first histories and did the first counting. Wartime deaths, including civilians, are loosely calculated at 40 million people. Joseph Stalin probably never said the line often attributed to him, that the death of one person is a tragedy and the death of a million people is a statistic. But it’s too often true. It’s hard to think of what 40 million deaths means--but here’s one way of trying to conceive of it: More people probably died in World War I than currently live in Canada. Thanks for watching. We’ll see you next time.'

The Central Powers benefited when the Ottoman Empire joined its side in October 1914, while Italy joined the Allies in 1915 after being promised major territorial gains upon victory. And combatants also enlisted soldiers from colonies and conscripted hundreds of thousands more to do menial labor. The French, for example, forced some 100,000 southeast Asians into the ranks of soldiers and menial workers, while approximately 1.5 million Indians served Britain, with 74,000 killed in battle. Many people in colonial armies on the western front were put into the very front ranks, meaning they would take the first machine gun fire. More than 2 million Asians and hundreds of thousands of Africans, in addition to Australians and New Zealanders fought on the many battlefields of World War I as the war moved into the Middle East, Africa, and East Asia. And this meant that life within these armies was often very diverse, with people from different villages, and nations, and even continents sharing life in the trenches. By encountering lots of different people, soldiers learned about other ways of living than had reached them in their mostly rural lives. This included many soldiers from colonies, who learned much about their colonizers’ technologies, and also about their barbarism. And some soldiers recreated domestic life in the trenches, observing teatime and attending to healing wounded or sick comrades. Early in the war especially, they also sometimes fraternized with the enemy--in the famous Christmas Truce of 1914, soldiers from both sides on the Western Front left their trenches and met in No Man’s Land, playing soccer, exchanging mementos, and serenading each other. “The Germans don’t want to fight any more than we do,” said one seasoned British soldier. But despite the fraternization, the trenches were largely hellish pits of corpses, filth and excrement. Forced marches passed not over solid roads but over pathways composed of dead bodies. New technology unfolded during the war, which added to the death count. Beginning in 1915 soldiers suffered blinding attacks from mustard, phosgene, chlorine, and other poisonous gases, developed in the rising chemical industry. Airplanes, picked up by the Europeans faster than the Americans, fought one another at close range with guns and began dropping bombs on cities. The fire power wielded by armies was so destructive that journalists were not allowed to photograph battlefield scenes, where mutilated and rotting corpses were strewn for miles and where limbs and other body parts hung, stuck in trees. But artists such as German soldier Otto Dix did seek to capture the soldier’s horror at the battlefield experience. We have a long history of romanticizing war in our culture, but World War I was horrible. The art historian Robert Hughes has written of the peculiarly modernist hell of repetition, and by that measure, and so many others, World War I was hell. Amidst the chaos and brutality of the war, ethnic cleansing flourished across eastern Europe as armies targeted Jews and Poles, to name just two groups. In the Ottoman Empire, Russians and their Armenian allies slaughtered entire Muslim villages, while the Central Powers slaughtered Armenians in a deadly back and forth. And then, in the spring of 1915, the Ottoman government ordered their troops to eradicate Armenians more systematically, leading to the torture and death of an estimated 600,000 to 1 million people. This wasn’t a response to a specific uprising of the Armenians; it was a genocide that deliberately aimed to eliminate as much of the Armenian population as possible. War at sea was also at a deadly stalemate--including the deployment of battleships and submarines on both sides. In 1917, the German general staff resumed submarine attacks on Allied shipping, after having stopped the practice for fear that the United States might enter the war on behalf of the Allied powers. And then that spring, the United States responded by entering the war on behalf of the Allied powers. But their participation was not militarily effective until 1918 because weapons needed to be manufactured and recruits needed to be called up, and trained, and transported to Europe. In the meantime, Europeans were innovating militarily, especially by developing a tactic of concentrated attack at a single point. This puncturing would allow the attacker to move behind enemy lines. But war-weariness was simultaneously bringing civilian uprisings, especially in Russia, mutinies, especially among the French; and even starvation in cities like Vienna. Spanish influenza, a variety of flu that often struck the young and healthy, was also beginning to attack troops. And yet amid all of this collapse, rulers firmly rejected peacemaking or even compromise. In 1915, a group of activist women visited heads of state with a peace plan, which was dismissed--but it did reappear in altered form as U.S. President Wilson’s Fourteen Points. But instead of peace, Kaiser William raged “Only in the ruins of London will I forgive Georgy.” (Georgy being his cousin King George V.) And political leader Georges Clemenceau of France called for a “war to the death.” When Habsburg Emperor Francis Joseph died in November 1916, his subjects were too weakened to mourn. But his successor Emperor Karl did eventually began to seek the war’s end, as did the German Reichstag in the summer of 1917. I know it’s not the time for a joke, but...Emperor Karl? Sometimes, even in the darkest days, history just offers up the most magnificent names All right, back to the war. Even as the politicians began to waver, military leadership remained determined. The Germans tried to puncture Allied lines in a spring 1918 offensive,but victory eluded them as the Allies brought out airplanes and tanks. And then, in the summer of 1918 the Allies, assisted now by American forces, drove the Central Powers eastward toward Germany. Casualties for the six months of German offensives reached two million as their army disintegrated. By January 1918 President Wilson had issued his aforementioned Fourteen Points, a set of principles on which peace should be based. As the war continued taking its grim toll, its end began to look plausible to many in the civilian leadership because Wilson called for a rational settlement rather than a revenge-driven surrender. By the autumn of 1918, not only were soldiers deserting the Central Powers, civilians across Germany were also in rebellion. And so eventually the leadership of Germany negotiated an armistice. On November 9, Kaiser William fled his empire, and on November 11 an armistice was signed. The war was over sorta. In the Habsburg Empire, the various ethnicities were declaring their independence, and Russians were mired in their revolution, which had broken out the previous spring. And the Ottoman Empire was still fighting and would continue to do so as Britain hoped to take over Constantinople with the help of its Greek, American and other allies. So the end of the War to End All Wars did not actually feature an end even to that war. The extent of the loss of human life in World War I is unknowable. But as historians dig into the evidence, it’s clear that deaths were far greater than initially calculated. Only now are historians paying enough attention to the war on the eastern front in large part because the victors wrote the first histories and did the first counting. Wartime deaths, including civilians, are loosely calculated at 40 million people. Joseph Stalin probably never said the line often attributed to him, that the death of one person is a tragedy and the death of a million people is a statistic. But it’s too often true. It’s hard to think of what 40 million deaths means--but here’s one way of trying to conceive of it: More people probably died in World War I than currently live in Canada. Thanks for watching. We’ll see you next time.'

ERROR:root:payload: ']Neural Network in 3 minutes | Deep Learning for DummiesWAQI (710 AM) is a commercial radio station licensed to Miami, Florida, United States, featuring a Spanish-language talk format known as Radio Mambí. Currently owned by Uforia Audio Network, the radio division of TelevisaUnivision, the station broadcasts at 50,000 watts during the day and 6,300 watts at night and serves as South Florida\'s designated primary entry point for the Emergency Alert System, one of three in the state.[1] The studios are located at Univision\'s Miami headquarters, and the transmitter is located at the intersection of U.S. 41 and Florida State Road 997, near the edge of the Everglades.\n\nThe history of today\'s WAQI begins with the establishment of WFTL in Fort Lauderdale in 1939. The tiny local station raised its profile by switching to its present frequency in 1943 and becoming the highest-power station in Florida at the time. It was acquired by George B. Storer in 1944 after a controversial acquisition that resulted in government scrutiny, moving to Miami the next year. WGBS grew into a 50,000-watt station, and Storer became headquartered in Miami, starting first an FM station and an ill-fated TV station. It generally aired an adult music format after the 1950s. When Storer opted to exit radio at the end of 1978, Jefferson-Pilot Communications purchased its Miami radio properties, converting the low-rated WGBS to a talk format in February 1983.\n\nIn 1985, Jefferson-Pilot sold WGBS to buy WNWS (790 AM), then its direct competitor, merging the two stations\' programming on the 790 frequency that had a better signal into Broward County. The 710 facility, with its strong signal into Cuba, was then spun off to Cuban-American businessman Amancio Suárez, resulting in the foundation of WAQI Radio Mambí. Known for its hardline anticommunist stance from the start, Mambí has ranked among the most popular Spanish-language stations in South Florida and is also jammed by the Cuban government; however, it has also been criticized for disseminating disinformation, particularly by groups on the left. Sales of Radio Mambí in 1994 and 2022 have attracted attention in political circles.\nOn January 10, 1939, Tom M. Bryan filed for a construction permit to build a new local radio station to serve Fort Lauderdale on the frequency of 1370 kHz, with 250 watts during the day and 100 at night.[2] The Federal Communications Commission granted Bryan the permit on July 12, 1939, and on December 3, 1939, WFTL made its first broadcasts from studios and a transmitter site on Andrews Avenue.[3] Bryan had brought other pioneering local businesses to Lauderdale prior to building WFTL; these included the city\'s first ice plant and telephone company.[4] The station upgraded nighttime power to 250 watts in 1940 and moved to 1400 kHz in 1941 with the frequency changes of NARBA.[2]\n\nIn February 1941, Bryan filed to sell WFTL to Ralph A. Horton. While there was concern that the association of Horton with a local newspaper, the morning Fort Lauderdale Times,[5] could block the sale,[6] the FCC approved on July 1.[2] Within months of Horton acquiring WFTL, the station joined the Mutual Broadcasting System, becoming the closest Mutual station to Miami,[7] and in October, Horton filed to move to 710 kHz and increase power to 10,000 watts from a new transmitter site west of the city, which the FCC approved on January 6, 1942.[2] At the time, one Miami station (WIOD) broadcast with 5,000 watts, and a second, WQAM, was slated to join it.[8] Materials restrictions associated with the outbreak of World War II slowed work, but by late 1942, the building expansion had been completed, as had the necessary three-tower array.[9] Not only was the station increasing its power to become the largest in Florida, it announced it would set up Miami studios in the Mayfair Theater, quarters originally used by the Miami Conservatory of Music.[10]\n\nThe upgrade and new frequency took effect on February 24, 1943, bringing a full-power Mutual signal to Miami.[11]\nTwo months after activating the 10,000-watt facility and new Miami studios, Horton—later citing his lack of knowledge of the radio business[12]—announced he would sell WFTL to the Fort Industry Company, led by George B. Storer, for $275,000; Storer would move the station on a full-time basis to Miami,[5] where he owned a home in Surfside.[13] The FCC slated the transaction for hearing, during which time it was revealed that Fort Industry was keeping the station afloat while the transaction was pending.[14]\nThe FCC approved of the sale on February 29, 1944, and work began to move the station\'s operations to Miami on a full-time basis.[12] However, several legal concerns and even questions before a House committee investigating the FCC were raised over two issues: the fact that the same attorney, Andrew Bennett, worked for both Horton and Storer, and allegations that FCC chairman James Lawrence Fly had accepted a $17.30 gratuity from Storer to pay for a stay at an Atlanta hotel.[15] Fly denied having any influence with regard to the sale of WFTL.[16] John Sirica, serving as counsel to the House committee, declared that there had been a conspiracy by Fly, Storer, Bennett and others to obtain WFTL.[17] An editorial in the Fort Lauderdale Daily News pointed out Horton\'s admitted lack of expertise, quipping that "he didn\'t know a kilocycle from a station-break and he admitted it" and noting that Horton had entered into a refinancing contract that was an unauthorized transfer of control.[18] A final statement from the committee, released at the start of 1945, chided Fly for "putting the heat on" to pressure Horton to sell, declared Bennett\'s actions to be a "double-crossing" of Horton, and found the sale price "entirely too low" in view of WFTL\'s business prospects.[19]'

The tiny local station raised its profile by switching to its present frequency in 1943 and becoming the highest-power station in Florida at the time. It was acquired by George B. Storer in 1944 after a controversial acquisition that resulted in government scrutiny, moving to Miami the next year. WGBS grew into a 50,000-watt station, and Storer became headquartered in Miami, starting first an FM station and an ill-fated TV station. It generally aired an adult music format after the 1950s.

The 710 facility, with its strong signal into Cuba, was then spun off to Cuban-American businessman Amancio Suárez, resulting in the foundation of WAQI Radio Mambí. Known for its hardline anticommunist stance from the start, Mambí has ranked among the most popular Spanish-language stations in South Florida and is also jammed by the Cuban government; however, it has also been criticized for disseminating disinformation, particularly by groups on the left. Sales of Radio Mambí in 1994 and 2022 have attracted attention in political circles.\nOn January 10, 1939, Tom M. Bryan filed for a construction permit to build a new local radio station to serve Fort Lauderdale on the frequency of 1370 kHz, with 250 watts during the day and 100 at night.[2] The Federal Communications Commission granted Bryan the permit on July 12, 1939, and on December 3, 1939, WFTL made its first broadcasts from studios and a transmitter site on Andrews Avenue.[3] Bryan had brought other pioneering local businesses to Lauderdale prior to building WFTL; these included the city\'s first ice plant and telephone company.[4] The station upgraded nighttime power to 250 watts in 1940 and moved to 1400 kHz in 1941 with the frequency changes of NARBA.[2]\n\nIn February 1941, Bryan filed to sell WFTL to Ralph A. Horton. While there was concern that the association of Horton with a local newspaper, the morning Fort Lauderdale Times,[5] could block the sale,[6] the FCC approved on July 1.[2] Within months of Horton acquiring WFTL, the station joined the Mutual Broadcasting System, becoming the closest Mutual station to Miami,[7] and in October, Horton filed to move to 710 kHz and increase power to 10,000 watts from a new transmitter site west of the city, which the FCC approved on January 6, 1942.[2] At the time, one Miami station (WIOD) broadcast with 5,000 watts, and a second, WQAM, was slated to join it.[8] Materials restrictions associated with the outbreak of World War II slowed work, but by late 1942, the building expansion had been completed, as had the necessary three-tower array.[9] Not only was the station increasing its power to become the largest in Florida, it announced it would set up Miami studios in the Mayfair Theater, quarters originally used by the Miami Conservatory of Music.[10]\n\nThe upgrade and new frequency took effect on February 24, 1943, bringing a full-power Mutual signal to Miami.[11]\nTwo months after activating the 10,000-watt facility and new Miami studios, Horton—later citing his lack of knowledge of the radio business[12]—announced he would sell WFTL to the Fort Industry Company, led by George B. Storer, for $275,000; Storer would move the station on a full-time basis to Miami,[5] where he owned a home in Surfside.[13] The FCC slated the transaction for hearing, during which time it was revealed that Fort Industry was keeping the station afloat while the transaction was pending.[14]\nThe FCC approved of the sale on February 29, 1944, and work began to move the station\'s operations to Miami on a full-time basis.[12] However, several legal concerns and even questions before a House committee investigating the FCC were raised over two issues: the fact that the same attorney, Andrew Bennett, worked for both Horton and Storer, and allegations that FCC chairman James Lawrence Fly had accepted a $17.30 gratuity from Storer to pay for a stay at an Atlanta hotel.[15] Fly denied having any influence with regard to the sale of WFTL.[16] John Sirica, serving as counsel to the House committee, declared that there had been a conspiracy by Fly, Storer, Bennett and others to obtain WFTL.[17] An editorial in the Fort Lauderdale Daily News pointed out Horton\'s admitted lack of expertise, quipping that "he didn\'t know a kilocycle from a station-break and he admitted it" and noting that Horton had entered into a refinancing contract that was an unauthorized transfer of control.[18] A final statement from the committee, released at the start of 1945, chided Fly for "putting the heat on" to pressure Horton to sell, declared Bennett\'s actions to be a "double-crossing" of Horton, and found the sale price "entirely too low" in view of WFTL\'s business prospects.[19]\nIn December 1944, WFTL announced it would leave Mutual on June 15, 1945, to join the Blue Network, replacing WKAT (1360 AM).[20] Prior to the change in network affiliation, the station dropped the WFTL designation and took Storer\'s initials as its own, becoming WGBS on April 16.[21][2] WGBS and WQAM exchanged network affiliations in 1947, with WGBS picking up the CBS affiliation,[22] as part of a group deal that also gave affiliation to Fort Industry\'s WWVA in Wheeling, West Virginia, and WAGA in Atlanta.[23] The FCC approved a daytime power increase to 50,000 watts in 1947, and work was completed in January 1949,[2] making WGBS the first 50,000-watt station in Florida.[24] In 1952, the Fort Industry Company, named prior to owning radio and television properties, changed its name to Storer Broadcasting Company.[25]\nIn 1948, an FM radio station was launched primarily to simulcast WGBS\'s AM transmission, as WGBS-FM.[26] However, by 1957, it was operating just six hours a day, six days a week.[27]\n\nStorer had been attempting to enter Miami television, but ownership limit complications complicated its path until Storer was able to buy a UHF television station, WFTL-TV (channel 23), in 1954, the same year it moved its corporate offices to Miami Beach.[a][28] Like with WFTL radio a decade before, Storer moved the station to Miami as WGBS-TV.[29] After losing the NBC affiliation to new VHF station WCKT (channel 7) in 1956, WGBS-TV continued for a year as an independent before shutting down on April 13, 1957, and selling its physical plant to Public Service Television, which was preparing to put WPST-TV (channel 10) on the air;[30][31] Storer declared it to have never been profitable.[32]\nCBS Radio\'s elimination of the bulk of its entertainment programming on November 28, 1960,[33] spurred WGBS to disaffiliate from the network and become an independent.[34] Likewise, WGBS adopted a beautiful music/middle of the road format similar to one successfully implemented by co-owned WJW in Cleveland, Ohio, earlier in the year.[35] To assist the 10-person news department, WGBS established or arranged for international news bureaus throughout Europe and Asia, along with bureaus in the U.S.[36] In October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, WGBS\'s high power became of utility to the federal government. It requisitioned airtime on WGBS, WCKR (the former WIOD), and WMIE for three weeks to broadcast Spanish-language Voice of America output to Cuba at night; during this time, normal WGBS programs were heard only on FM.[37] In November, this was relaxed after VOA built its own station at Marathon, though WGBS still continued to air three hours a day of VOA output at night.[38]\n\nIn 1964, Storer made a $1 million investment in WGBS. It built a new transmitter site in South Broward, allowing it to raise its nighttime power to 50,000 watts, and a new, colonial-style office building was constructed at 710 Brickell Avenue, leaving the Mayfair after 20 years.[39] The 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) building opened in December 1965;[40] Storer commissioned a custom song, "Make Ours Miami", to mark the occasion, and local governments declared "WGBS Week" in Miami.[41] Arnie Warren, formerly of WKAT, joined WGBS in 1966 and would serve as its morning man for 13 years.[42] By this time, the station was cemented as an adult contemporary outlet.[43] WGBS-FM also saw an upgrade: Storer repurchased the former WGBS-TV transmission tower from Public Service Television (whose license for WPST-TV had been revoked by the FCC)[44] to help enable a power upgrade to 100,000 watts.[45] The station broadcast the Miami Floridians of the American Basketball Association for three of their four seasons of existence, taking over from WOCN (1450 AM) in 1969.[46]\n\nStorer renamed WGBS-FM as WJHR, in honor of Storer Broadcasting co-founder J. Harold Ryan, in 1969,[47] then sold off both it and their Detroit FM outlet in 1970 to Bartell Broadcasters.[48] Storer would return to FM by buying WLYF (101.5 FM) from Sudbrink Communications for $5.56 million in early 1978.[49]\nStorer opted to exit radio entirely in late 1978 and began to find buyers for its radio properties, using the profits to invest further in cable TV systems.[50][51] Storer asked $14 million for its Miami radio operation, but WGBS and WLYF-FM were ultimately sold for $12.5 million to Jefferson-Pilot Communications in February 1979;[52] the FCC approved of the transaction that December.[2] The stations moved in 1982 to studios in North Dade, allowing Jefferson-Pilot to sell the Brickell studios to Northern Trust Bank of Florida in what marked a record for a property sale on that major thoroughfare.[53] (The building, last used by the Miami Today newspaper, was demolished in 2013.[54])\n\nRatings for the adult contemporary format declined during Jefferson-Pilot ownership as music listening continued to shift to FM, and WGBS was the last station to broadcast such a format on the AM dial.[55] In February 1983, WGBS switched to a news/talk format, with hosts including David Gold and Mike Siegel.[56] However, ratings were low throughout the run as three other stations battled it out with WGBS in that format, and by mid-1984, it was attracting ratings comparable to its prior adult contemporary sound with higher programming costs, though it was making a profit.[57]\nIn July 1985, Jefferson-Pilot announced it would purchase one of the direct competitors to WGBS, WNWS (790 AM), with its superior signal in Broward County and stronger ratings.[59][60] The stations worked toward a merger in November, in which four WNWS hosts and two from WGBS headed the new WNWS talk lineup.[61]\n\nBecause at the time no company could own multiple AM stations in the same area, the WGBS facility and license—though not the studios—was sold to the Mambisa Broadcasting Corporation for $3.5 million.[59] Mambisa was headed by Amancio Víctor Suárez, a 49-year-old self-made millionaire with no broadcast experience, and named for the mambises, Cuban independence fighters of the 19th century.[62] Suárez had arrived in Florida penniless as a 19-year-old, with interests in home construction and the manufacture of watches and telephone answering machines.[63]\n\nEven before full FCC approval of the underlying transfers, the merger of WGBS into WNWS became effective at noon on October 23, 1985,[64] when the call letters WGBS disappeared from Miami radio after 40 years to make way for WAQI. Temporary studios on SW 67th Avenue were used to start Radio Mambí while permanent facilities on Coral Way were built. Much like its direct format competitors—WQBA (1180 AM), WOCN (1450 AM) "Unión Radio", and WRHC (1550 AM)—Radio Mambí provided primarily news and talk programming alongside soap operas and music.[65] Unión Radio was raided heavily by the new WAQI and lost several popular personalities to the startup.[66]\n\nOne of the most attractive characteristics of the 710 facility to Mambisa was the physical plant. Whereas Jefferson-Pilot, competing for English-language listeners, wanted a signal with better Broward coverage, Mambisa got a bonus of import to its work: one of the best Miami signals into Cuba.[66][62] This fact was not lost on the Cuban government. Four days after the changeover to Radio Mambí, transmissions started for Radio Rebelde, one of Cuba\'s national radio stations, on transmitters on 710 kHz, as Radio Mambí entered what general manager Armando Pérez Roura called "a radio war with Castro" designed to block its anti-government programs from being heard in Cuba.[67] One transmitter at Santa Clara aired Rebelde, and another at Havana was noted as emitting a "high-frequency jamming buzz".[68] Rebelde The irony was that the main interference generated was not within Cuba, where station officials claimed to have a large audience, but in Florida, where high-power Radio Rebelde and WQBA signals clashed.[67] When WAQI was audible in Cuba, it offered an opposition viewpoint that reestablished contact between Cuban exiles and Cuba itself.[69]\n\nRadio Mambí rapidly became a popular station with the heavily Cuban Spanish-speaking audience in Miami by becoming the station of Cuba\'s exile community, close to the families of political prisoners and organized opposition movements while offering community service and cultural programming.[69] Suárez expanded into television with HBC, which produced the fledgling Telemundo network\'s first nightly newscast in January 1987 from Miami,[63] and, through another company, he bought FM station WTHM (98.3) in 1987[70] to relaunch it as WRTO-FM "Ritmo 98", the second full-time Spanish-language FM station in the city.[71][72]\n\nIn 1992, Radio Martí began to purchase an hour of airtime each night on WAQI and WQBA to broadcast programming to Cuba, utilizing a 1983 clause in the law that created Radio Martí permitting broadcasts over commercial stations if jamming had increased by 25 percent or more.[73] By 2007, Radio Mambí was being paid $182,500 every six months to broadcast the Radio Martí program.[74]\nOn June 3, 2022, Univision announced it would sell a package of 18 radio stations across 10 of its markets, primarily AM outlets in large cities (including WAQI and WQBA) and entire clusters in smaller markets such as McAllen, Texas, and Fresno, California, for $60 million to a new company known as Latino Media Network (LMN); Univision proposes to handle operations for a year under agreement before turning over operational control to LMN in the fourth quarter of 2023.[86]\n\nThe deal was immediately interpreted in a political context. Latino Media Network is headed by Stephanie Valencia, who headed Latino outreach for Barack Obama, and Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic activist, with investors and advisors including Eva Longoria, former Florida Republican Party chair Al Cárdenas, longtime television anchor María Elena Salinas, and former Miami-Dade College president Eduardo J. Padrón. Much of its funding comes from Lakestar Capital, associated with businessman and philanthropist George Soros.[87][88] Other Democratic groups had noted the prevalence of disinformation and antisemitism and the promotion of conspiracy theories, including the Great Replacement, on its air.[89] This was particularly well received by older listeners, loyal to stations like WAQI.[90] A 2021 report by media watchdogs, which focused on programs on Radio Mambí and WURN "Actualidad Radio" during one week in March 2021,[91] cited practices such as hosts not correcting callers\' incorrect statements, as well as recitations of false claims as news using sources such as Newsmax and The Daily Caller.[92] A former Univision executive told Graciela Mochkofsky of The New Yorker that Mambí\'s content was often "indefensible".[93]\n\nConservative political actors immediately feared that the change in ownership would lead to programming changes, particularly at Radio Mambí, that would marginalize their point of view. The head of Mothers Against Repression, Sylvia Iriondo, announced at a press conference held by the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, "We have grounds to be extremely concerned [...] We will resist any attempt to censor the voices of this community represented by these radio stations with all legal and legitimate means".[94] Other speakers included Florida lieutenant governor Jeanette Núñez, who recalled growing up listening to Radio Mambí in the car.[95] Six Republican lawmakers, five of them from the Florida delegation—senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, representatives Carlos A. Giménez, María Elvira Salazar, and Mario Díaz-Balart, as well as senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas—wrote a letter to FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel urging it to "thoroughly scrutinize" the transaction when filed and casting it as a "desperate" move by Democratic operatives, noting their concern over a proposed sale of WSUA (1260 AM) to ATV Holdings, which had fallen apart earlier that year.[96][97] The re-election campaign of Republican governor Ron DeSantis bought advertising time on WAQI and WQBA ($6,525 of it on WAQI[98]), airing 60-second commercials warning voters, "The left is taking control of our local media" and "they are coming with their ideological agenda", mentioning Soros "and his minions".[99] In an op-ed in the Miami Herald, Valencia and Morales Rocketto wrote of their commitment to free speech and free markets, noting that they "do not intend to change the spirit or character of what has made it popular and profitable".[100] However, several hosts departed the station, including Dania Alexandrino, Lourdes Ubieta, and Nelson Rubio, to start a new online radio station known as Americano Media, which promises to start the "first Spanish-language conservative talk radio network"; Ubieta claimed that Univision offered them and other presenters a bonus worth thousands of dollars in exchange for staying and signing a confidentiality agreement, which Pérez Castellón, who stayed, denied.[101]'
ERROR:root:orig input: 'Neural Network in 3 minutes | Deep Learning for DummiesWAQI (710 AM) is a commercial radio station licensed to Miami, Florida, United States, featuring a Spanish-language talk format known as Radio Mambí. Currently owned by Uforia Audio Network, the radio division of TelevisaUnivision, the station broadcasts at 50,000 watts during the day and 6,300 watts at night and serves as South Florida\'s designated primary entry point for the Emergency Alert System, one of three in the state.[1] The studios are located at Univision\'s Miami headquarters, and the transmitter is located at the intersection of U.S. 41 and Florida State Road 997, near the edge of the Everglades.\r\n\r\nThe history of today\'s WAQI begins with the establishment of WFTL in Fort Lauderdale in 1939. The tiny local station raised its profile by switching to its present frequency in 1943 and becoming the highest-power station in Florida at the time. It was acquired by George B. Storer in 1944 after a controversial acquisition that resulted in government scrutiny, moving to Miami the next year. WGBS grew into a 50,000-watt station, and Storer became headquartered in Miami, starting first an FM station and an ill-fated TV station. It generally aired an adult music format after the 1950s. When Storer opted to exit radio at the end of 1978, Jefferson-Pilot Communications purchased its Miami radio properties, converting the low-rated WGBS to a talk format in February 1983.\r\n\r\nIn 1985, Jefferson-Pilot sold WGBS to buy WNWS (790 AM), then its direct competitor, merging the two stations\' programming on the 790 frequency that had a better signal into Broward County. The 710 facility, with its strong signal into Cuba, was then spun off to Cuban-American businessman Amancio Suárez, resulting in the foundation of WAQI Radio Mambí. Known for its hardline anticommunist stance from the start, Mambí has ranked among the most popular Spanish-language stations in South Florida and is also jammed by the Cuban government; however, it has also been criticized for disseminating disinformation, particularly by groups on the left. Sales of Radio Mambí in 1994 and 2022 have attracted attention in political circles.\r\nOn January 10, 1939, Tom M. Bryan filed for a construction permit to build a new local radio station to serve Fort Lauderdale on the frequency of 1370 kHz, with 250 watts during the day and 100 at night.[2] The Federal Communications Commission granted Bryan the permit on July 12, 1939, and on December 3, 1939, WFTL made its first broadcasts from studios and a transmitter site on Andrews Avenue.[3] Bryan had brought other pioneering local businesses to Lauderdale prior to building WFTL; these included the city\'s first ice plant and telephone company.[4] The station upgraded nighttime power to 250 watts in 1940 and moved to 1400 kHz in 1941 with the frequency changes of NARBA.[2]\r\n\r\nIn February 1941, Bryan filed to sell WFTL to Ralph A. Horton. While there was concern that the association of Horton with a local newspaper, the morning Fort Lauderdale Times,[5] could block the sale,[6] the FCC approved on July 1.[2] Within months of Horton acquiring WFTL, the station joined the Mutual Broadcasting System, becoming the closest Mutual station to Miami,[7] and in October, Horton filed to move to 710 kHz and increase power to 10,000 watts from a new transmitter site west of the city, which the FCC approved on January 6, 1942.[2] At the time, one Miami station (WIOD) broadcast with 5,000 watts, and a second, WQAM, was slated to join it.[8] Materials restrictions associated with the outbreak of World War II slowed work, but by late 1942, the building expansion had been completed, as had the necessary three-tower array.[9] Not only was the station increasing its power to become the largest in Florida, it announced it would set up Miami studios in the Mayfair Theater, quarters originally used by the Miami Conservatory of Music.[10]\r\n\r\nThe upgrade and new frequency took effect on February 24, 1943, bringing a full-power Mutual signal to Miami.[11]\r\nTwo months after activating the 10,000-watt facility and new Miami studios, Horton—later citing his lack of knowledge of the radio business[12]—announced he would sell WFTL to the Fort Industry Company, led by George B. Storer, for $275,000; Storer would move the station on a full-time basis to Miami,[5] where he owned a home in Surfside.[13] The FCC slated the transaction for hearing, during which time it was revealed that Fort Industry was keeping the station afloat while the transaction was pending.[14]\r\nThe FCC approved of the sale on February 29, 1944, and work began to move the station\'s operations to Miami on a full-time basis.[12] However, several legal concerns and even questions before a House committee investigating the FCC were raised over two issues: the fact that the same attorney, Andrew Bennett, worked for both Horton and Storer, and allegations that FCC chairman James Lawrence Fly had accepted a $17.30 gratuity from Storer to pay for a stay at an Atlanta hotel.[15] Fly denied having any influence with regard to the sale of WFTL.[16] John Sirica, serving as counsel to the House committee, declared that there had been a conspiracy by Fly, Storer, Bennett and others to obtain WFTL.[17] An editorial in the Fort Lauderdale Daily News pointed out Horton\'s admitted lack of expertise, quipping that "he didn\'t know a kilocycle from a station-break and he admitted it" and noting that Horton had entered into a refinancing contract that was an unauthorized transfer of control.[18] A final statement from the committee, released at the start of 1945, chided Fly for "putting the heat on" to pressure Horton to sell, declared Bennett\'s actions to be a "double-crossing" of Horton, and found the sale price "entirely too low" in view of WFTL\'s business prospects.[19]\r\nIn December 1944, WFTL announced it would leave Mutual on June 15, 1945, to join the Blue Network, replacing WKAT (1360 AM).[20] Prior to the change in network affiliation, the station dropped the WFTL designation and took Storer\'s initials as its own, becoming WGBS on April 16.[21][2] WGBS and WQAM exchanged network affiliations in 1947, with WGBS picking up the CBS affiliation,[22] as part of a group deal that also gave affiliation to Fort Industry\'s WWVA in Wheeling, West Virginia, and WAGA in Atlanta.[23] The FCC approved a daytime power increase to 50,000 watts in 1947, and work was completed in January 1949,[2] making WGBS the first 50,000-watt station in Florida.[24] In 1952, the Fort Industry Company, named prior to owning radio and television properties, changed its name to Storer Broadcasting Company.[25]\r\nIn 1948, an FM radio station was launched primarily to simulcast WGBS\'s AM transmission, as WGBS-FM.[26] However, by 1957, it was operating just six hours a day, six days a week.[27]\r\n\r\nStorer had been attempting to enter Miami television, but ownership limit complications complicated its path until Storer was able to buy a UHF television station, WFTL-TV (channel 23), in 1954, the same year it moved its corporate offices to Miami Beach.[a][28] Like with WFTL radio a decade before, Storer moved the station to Miami as WGBS-TV.[29] After losing the NBC affiliation to new VHF station WCKT (channel 7) in 1956, WGBS-TV continued for a year as an independent before shutting down on April 13, 1957, and selling its physical plant to Public Service Television, which was preparing to put WPST-TV (channel 10) on the air;[30][31] Storer declared it to have never been profitable.[32]\r\nCBS Radio\'s elimination of the bulk of its entertainment programming on November 28, 1960,[33] spurred WGBS to disaffiliate from the network and become an independent.[34] Likewise, WGBS adopted a beautiful music/middle of the road format similar to one successfully implemented by co-owned WJW in Cleveland, Ohio, earlier in the year.[35] To assist the 10-person news department, WGBS established or arranged for international news bureaus throughout Europe and Asia, along with bureaus in the U.S.[36] In October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, WGBS\'s high power became of utility to the federal government. It requisitioned airtime on WGBS, WCKR (the former WIOD), and WMIE for three weeks to broadcast Spanish-language Voice of America output to Cuba at night; during this time, normal WGBS programs were heard only on FM.[37] In November, this was relaxed after VOA built its own station at Marathon, though WGBS still continued to air three hours a day of VOA output at night.[38]\r\n\r\nIn 1964, Storer made a $1 million investment in WGBS. It built a new transmitter site in South Broward, allowing it to raise its nighttime power to 50,000 watts, and a new, colonial-style office building was constructed at 710 Brickell Avenue, leaving the Mayfair after 20 years.[39] The 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) building opened in December 1965;[40] Storer commissioned a custom song, "Make Ours Miami", to mark the occasion, and local governments declared "WGBS Week" in Miami.[41] Arnie Warren, formerly of WKAT, joined WGBS in 1966 and would serve as its morning man for 13 years.[42] By this time, the station was cemented as an adult contemporary outlet.[43] WGBS-FM also saw an upgrade: Storer repurchased the former WGBS-TV transmission tower from Public Service Television (whose license for WPST-TV had been revoked by the FCC)[44] to help enable a power upgrade to 100,000 watts.[45] The station broadcast the Miami Floridians of the American Basketball Association for three of their four seasons of existence, taking over from WOCN (1450 AM) in 1969.[46]\r\n\r\nStorer renamed WGBS-FM as WJHR, in honor of Storer Broadcasting co-founder J. Harold Ryan, in 1969,[47] then sold off both it and their Detroit FM outlet in 1970 to Bartell Broadcasters.[48] Storer would return to FM by buying WLYF (101.5 FM) from Sudbrink Communications for $5.56 million in early 1978.[49]\r\nStorer opted to exit radio entirely in late 1978 and began to find buyers for its radio properties, using the profits to invest further in cable TV systems.[50][51] Storer asked $14 million for its Miami radio operation, but WGBS and WLYF-FM were ultimately sold for $12.5 million to Jefferson-Pilot Communications in February 1979;[52] the FCC approved of the transaction that December.[2] The stations moved in 1982 to studios in North Dade, allowing Jefferson-Pilot to sell the Brickell studios to Northern Trust Bank of Florida in what marked a record for a property sale on that major thoroughfare.[53] (The building, last used by the Miami Today newspaper, was demolished in 2013.[54])\r\n\r\nRatings for the adult contemporary format declined during Jefferson-Pilot ownership as music listening continued to shift to FM, and WGBS was the last station to broadcast such a format on the AM dial.[55] In February 1983, WGBS switched to a news/talk format, with hosts including David Gold and Mike Siegel.[56] However, ratings were low throughout the run as three other stations battled it out with WGBS in that format, and by mid-1984, it was attracting ratings comparable to its prior adult contemporary sound with higher programming costs, though it was making a profit.[57]\r\nIn July 1985, Jefferson-Pilot announced it would purchase one of the direct competitors to WGBS, WNWS (790 AM), with its superior signal in Broward County and stronger ratings.[59][60] The stations worked toward a merger in November, in which four WNWS hosts and two from WGBS headed the new WNWS talk lineup.[61]\r\n\r\nBecause at the time no company could own multiple AM stations in the same area, the WGBS facility and license—though not the studios—was sold to the Mambisa Broadcasting Corporation for $3.5 million.[59] Mambisa was headed by Amancio Víctor Suárez, a 49-year-old self-made millionaire with no broadcast experience, and named for the mambises, Cuban independence fighters of the 19th century.[62] Suárez had arrived in Florida penniless as a 19-year-old, with interests in home construction and the manufacture of watches and telephone answering machines.[63]\r\n\r\nEven before full FCC approval of the underlying transfers, the merger of WGBS into WNWS became effective at noon on October 23, 1985,[64] when the call letters WGBS disappeared from Miami radio after 40 years to make way for WAQI. Temporary studios on SW 67th Avenue were used to start Radio Mambí while permanent facilities on Coral Way were built. Much like its direct format competitors—WQBA (1180 AM), WOCN (1450 AM) "Unión Radio", and WRHC (1550 AM)—Radio Mambí provided primarily news and talk programming alongside soap operas and music.[65] Unión Radio was raided heavily by the new WAQI and lost several popular personalities to the startup.[66]\r\n\r\nOne of the most attractive characteristics of the 710 facility to Mambisa was the physical plant.

Giménez, María Elvira Salazar, and Mario Díaz-Balart, as well as senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas—wrote a letter to FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel urging it to \"thoroughly scrutinize\" the transaction when filed and casting it as a \"desperate\" move by Democratic operatives, noting their concern over a proposed sale of WSUA (1260 AM) to ATV Holdings, which had fallen apart earlier that year.[96][97] The re-election campaign of Republican governor Ron DeSantis bought advertising time on WAQI and WQBA ($6,525 of it on WAQI[98]), airing 60-second commercials warning voters, \"The left is taking control of our local media\" and \"they are coming with their ideological agenda\", mentioning Soros \"and his minions\".[99]","In an op-ed in the Miami Herald, Valencia and Morales Rocketto wrote of their commitment to free speech and free markets, noting that they \"do not intend to change the spirit or character of what has made it popular and profitable\".[100]","However, several hosts departed the station, including Dania Alexandrino, Lourdes Ubieta, and Nelson Rubio, to start a new online radio station known as Americano Media, which promises to start the \"first Spanish-language conservative talk radio network\"; Ubieta claimed that Univision offered them and other presenters a bonus worth thousands of dollars in exchange for staying and signing a confidentiality agreement, which Pérez Castellón, who stayed, denied.[101]"]]

Harold Ryan, in 1969,[47] then sold off both it and their Detroit FM outlet in 1970 to Bartell Broadcasters.[48] Storer would return to FM by buying WLYF (101.5 FM) from Sudbrink Communications for $5.56 million in early 1978.[49]', 'Storer asked $14 million for its Miami radio operation, but WGBS and WLYF-FM were ultimately sold for $12.5 million to Jefferson-Pilot Communications in February 1979;[52] the FCC approved of the transaction that December.[2] The stations moved in 1982 to studios in North Dade, allowing Jefferson-Pilot to sell the Brickell studios to Northern Trust Bank of Florida in what marked a record for a property sale on that major thoroughfare.[53] (The building, last used by the Miami Today newspaper, was demolished in 2013.[54])', 'Two months after activating the 10,000-watt facility and new Miami studios, Horton—later citing his lack of knowledge of the radio business[12]—announced he would sell WFTL to the Fort Industry Company, led by George B. Storer, for $275,000; Storer would move the station on a full-time basis to Miami,[5] where he owned a home in Surfside.[13]', "Radio Mambí rapidly became a popular station with the heavily Cuban Spanish-speaking audience in Miami by becoming the station of Cuba's exile community, close to the families of political prisoners and organized opposition movements while offering community service and cultural programming.[69] In 1992, Radio Martí began to purchase an hour of airtime each night on WAQI and WQBA to broadcast programming to Cuba, utilizing a 1983 clause in the law that created Radio Martí permitting broadcasts over commercial stations if jamming had increased by 25 percent or more.[73]", 'Whereas Jefferson-Pilot, competing for English-language listeners, wanted a signal with better Broward coverage, Mambisa got a bonus of import to its work: one of the best Miami signals into Cuba.[66][62] Four days after the changeover to Radio Mambí, transmissions started for Radio Rebelde, one of Cuba\'s national radio stations, on transmitters on 710 kHz, as Radio Mambí entered what general manager Armando Pérez Roura called "a radio war with Castro" designed to block its anti-government programs from being heard in Cuba.[67]', 'Because at the time no company could own multiple AM stations in the same area, the WGBS facility and license—though not the studios—was sold to the Mambisa Broadcasting Corporation for $3.5 million.[59] Suárez had arrived in Florida penniless as a 19-year-old, with interests in home construction and the manufacture of watches and telephone answering machines.[63]  Even before full FCC approval of the underlying transfers, the merger of WGBS into WNWS became effective at noon on October 23, 1985,[64] when the call letters']), ('questions', ['What does Radio Mamb<unk> serve as?', "What company did Suarez work with to produce the Telemundo network's first nightly newscast?", 'How much did Univision pay for the package of 18 stations in 2022?', 'When did the FCC approve the move?', 'Who was the founder of Storer Broadcasting?', 'What bank bought the Brickell studios in 1982?', 'Where did Storer move WFTL?', 'When did Radio Mart<unk> begin to purchase airtime?', 'Who was the general manager of Radio Mamb<unk>?', 'When did the merger of WGBS and WNWS become effective?']), ('answers', ["South Florida's designated primary entry point for the Emergency Alert System", 'HBC', '60 million', 'January 6, 1942', 'J.

ERROR:root:payload: 'Neural Network in 3 minutes | Deep Learning for DummiesWAQI (710 AM) is a commercial radio station licensed to Miami, Florida, United States, featuring a Spanish-language talk format known as Radio Mambí. Currently owned by Uforia Audio Network, the radio division of TelevisaUnivision, the station broadcasts at 50,000 watts during the day and 6,300 watts at night and serves as South Florida\'s designated primary entry point for the Emergency Alert System, one of three in the state.[1] The studios are located at Univision\'s Miami headquarters, and the transmitter is located at the intersection of U.S. 41 and Florida State Road 997, near the edge of the Everglades.\n\nThe history of today\'s WAQI begins with the establishment of WFTL in Fort Lauderdale in 1939. The tiny local station raised its profile by switching to its present frequency in 1943 and becoming the highest-power station in Florida at the time. It was acquired by George B. Storer in 1944 after a controversial acquisition that resulted in government scrutiny, moving to Miami the next year. WGBS grew into a 50,000-watt station, and Storer became headquartered in Miami, starting first an FM station and an ill-fated TV station. It generally aired an adult music format after the 1950s. When Storer opted to exit radio at the end of 1978, Jefferson-Pilot Communications purchased its Miami radio properties, converting the low-rated WGBS to a talk format in February 1983.\n\nIn 1985, Jefferson-Pilot sold WGBS to buy WNWS (790 AM), then its direct competitor, merging the two stations\' programming on the 790 frequency that had a better signal into Broward County. The 710 facility, with its strong signal into Cuba, was then spun off to Cuban-American businessman Amancio Suárez, resulting in the foundation of WAQI Radio Mambí. Known for its hardline anticommunist stance from the start, Mambí has ranked among the most popular Spanish-language stations in South Florida and is also jammed by the Cuban government; however, it has also been criticized for disseminating disinformation, particularly by groups on the left. Sales of Radio Mambí in 1994 and 2022 have attracted attention in political circles.\nOn January 10, 1939, Tom M. Bryan filed for a construction permit to build a new local radio station to serve Fort Lauderdale on the frequency of 1370 kHz, with 250 watts during the day and 100 at night.[2] The Federal Communications Commission granted Bryan the permit on July 12, 1939, and on December 3, 1939, WFTL made its first broadcasts from studios and a transmitter site on Andrews Avenue.[3] Bryan had brought other pioneering local businesses to Lauderdale prior to building WFTL; these included the city\'s first ice plant and telephone company.[4] The station upgraded nighttime power to 250 watts in 1940 and moved to 1400 kHz in 1941 with the frequency changes of NARBA.[2]\n\nIn February 1941, Bryan filed to sell WFTL to Ralph A. Horton. While there was concern that the association of Horton with a local newspaper, the morning Fort Lauderdale Times,[5] could block the sale,[6] the FCC approved on July 1.[2] Within months of Horton acquiring WFTL, the station joined the Mutual Broadcasting System, becoming the closest Mutual station to Miami,[7] and in October, Horton filed to move to 710 kHz and increase power to 10,000 watts from a new transmitter site west of the city, which the FCC approved on January 6, 1942.[2] At the time, one Miami station (WIOD) broadcast with 5,000 watts, and a second, WQAM, was slated to join it.[8] Materials restrictions associated with the outbreak of World War II slowed work, but by late 1942, the building expansion had been completed, as had the necessary three-tower array.[9] Not only was the station increasing its power to become the largest in Florida, it announced it would set up Miami studios in the Mayfair Theater, quarters originally used by the Miami Conservatory of Music.[10]\n\nThe upgrade and new frequency took effect on February 24, 1943, bringing a full-power Mutual signal to Miami.[11]\nTwo months after activating the 10,000-watt facility and new Miami studios, Horton—later citing his lack of knowledge of the radio business[12]—announced he would sell WFTL to the Fort Industry Company, led by George B. Storer, for $275,000; Storer would move the station on a full-time basis to Miami,[5] where he owned a home in Surfside.[13] The FCC slated the transaction for hearing, during which time it was revealed that Fort Industry was keeping the station afloat while the transaction was pending.[14]\nThe FCC approved of the sale on February 29, 1944, and work began to move the station\'s operations to Miami on a full-time basis.[12] However, several legal concerns and even questions before a House committee investigating the FCC were raised over two issues: the fact that the same attorney, Andrew Bennett, worked for both Horton and Storer, and allegations that FCC chairman James Lawrence Fly had accepted a $17.30 gratuity from Storer to pay for a stay at an Atlanta hotel.[15] Fly denied having any influence with regard to the sale of WFTL.[16] John Sirica, serving as counsel to the House committee, declared that there had been a conspiracy by Fly, Storer, Bennett and others to obtain WFTL.[17] An editorial in the Fort Lauderdale Daily News pointed out Horton\'s admitted lack of expertise, quipping that "he didn\'t know a kilocycle from a station-break and he admitted it" and noting that Horton had entered into a refinancing contract that was an unauthorized transfer of control.[18] A final statement from the committee, released at the start of 1945, chided Fly for "putting the heat on" to pressure Horton to sell, declared Bennett\'s actions to be a "double-crossing" of Horton, and found the sale price "entirely too low" in view of WFTL\'s business prospects.[19]\nIn December 1944, WFTL announced it would leave Mutual on June 15, 1945, to join the Blue Network, replacing WKAT (1360 AM).[20] Prior to the change in network affiliation, the station dropped the WFTL designation and took Storer\'s initials as its own, becoming WGBS on April 16.[21][2] WGBS and WQAM exchanged network affiliations in 1947, with WGBS picking up the CBS affiliation,[22] as part of a group deal that also gave affiliation to Fort Industry\'s WWVA in Wheeling, West Virginia, and WAGA in Atlanta.[23] The FCC approved a daytime power increase to 50,000 watts in 1947, and work was completed in January 1949,[2] making WGBS the first 50,000-watt station in Florida.[24] In 1952, the Fort Industry Company, named prior to owning radio and television properties, changed its name to Storer Broadcasting Company.[25]\nIn 1948, an FM radio station was launched primarily to simulcast WGBS\'s AM transmission, as WGBS-FM.[26] However, by 1957, it was operating just six hours a day, six days a week.[27]\n\nStorer had been attempting to enter Miami television, but ownership limit complications complicated its path until Storer was able to buy a UHF television station, WFTL-TV (channel 23), in 1954, the same year it moved its corporate offices to Miami Beach.[a][28] Like with WFTL radio a decade before, Storer moved the station to Miami as WGBS-TV.[29] After losing the NBC affiliation to new VHF station WCKT (channel 7) in 1956, WGBS-TV continued for a year as an independent before shutting down on April 13, 1957, and selling its physical plant to Public Service Television, which was preparing to put WPST-TV (channel 10) on the air;[30][31] Storer declared it to have never been profitable.[32]\nCBS Radio\'s elimination of the bulk of its entertainment programming on November 28, 1960,[33] spurred WGBS to disaffiliate from the network and become an independent.[34] Likewise, WGBS adopted a beautiful music/middle of the road format similar to one successfully implemented by co-owned WJW in Cleveland, Ohio, earlier in the year.[35] To assist the 10-person news department, WGBS established or arranged for international news bureaus throughout Europe and Asia, along with bureaus in the U.S.[36] In October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, WGBS\'s high power became of utility to the federal government. It requisitioned airtime on WGBS, WCKR (the former WIOD), and WMIE for three weeks to broadcast Spanish-language Voice of America output to Cuba at night; during this time, normal WGBS programs were heard only on FM.[37] In November, this was relaxed after VOA built its own station at Marathon, though WGBS still continued to air three hours a day of VOA output at night.[38]\n\nIn 1964, Storer made a $1 million investment in WGBS. It built a new transmitter site in South Broward, allowing it to raise its nighttime power to 50,000 watts, and a new, colonial-style office building was constructed at 710 Brickell Avenue, leaving the Mayfair after 20 years.[39] The 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) building opened in December 1965;[40] Storer commissioned a custom song, "Make Ours Miami", to mark the occasion, and local governments declared "WGBS Week" in Miami.[41] Arnie Warren, formerly of WKAT, joined WGBS in 1966 and would serve as its morning man for 13 years.[42] By this time, the station was cemented as an adult contemporary outlet.[43] WGBS-FM also saw an upgrade: Storer repurchased the former WGBS-TV transmission tower from Public Service Television (whose license for WPST-TV had been revoked by the FCC)[44] to help enable a power upgrade to 100,000 watts.[45] The station broadcast the Miami Floridians of the American Basketball Association for three of their four seasons of existence, taking over from WOCN (1450 AM) in 1969.[46]\n\nStorer renamed WGBS-FM as WJHR, in honor of Storer Broadcasting co-founder J. Harold Ryan, in 1969,[47] then sold off both it and their Detroit FM outlet in 1970 to Bartell Broadcasters.[48] Storer would return to FM by buying WLYF (101.5 FM) from Sudbrink Communications for $5.56 million in early 1978.[49]\nStorer opted to exit radio entirely in late 1978 and began to find buyers for its radio properties, using the profits to invest further in cable TV systems.[50][51] Storer asked $14 million for its Miami radio operation, but WGBS and WLYF-FM were ultimately sold for $12.5 million to Jefferson-Pilot Communications in February 1979;[52] the FCC approved of the transaction that December.[2] The stations moved in 1982 to studios in North Dade, allowing Jefferson-Pilot to sell the Brickell studios to Northern Trust Bank of Florida in what marked a record for a property sale on that major thoroughfare.[53] (The building, last used by the Miami Today newspaper, was demolished in 2013.[54])\n\nRatings for the adult contemporary format declined during Jefferson-Pilot ownership as music listening continued to shift to FM, and WGBS was the last station to broadcast such a format on the AM dial.[55] In February 1983, WGBS switched to a news/talk format, with hosts including David Gold and Mike Siegel.[56] However, ratings were low throughout the run as three other stations battled it out with WGBS in that format, and by mid-1984, it was attracting ratings comparable to its prior adult contemporary sound with higher programming costs, though it was making a profit.[57]\nIn July 1985, Jefferson-Pilot announced it would purchase one of the direct competitors to WGBS, WNWS (790 AM), with its superior signal in Broward County and stronger ratings.[59][60] The stations worked toward a merger in November, in which four WNWS hosts and two from WGBS headed the new WNWS talk lineup.[61]\n\nBecause at the time no company could own multiple AM stations in the same area, the WGBS facility and license—though not the studios—was sold to the Mambisa Broadcasting Corporation for $3.5 million.[59] Mambisa was headed by Amancio Víctor Suárez, a 49-year-old self-made millionaire with no broadcast experience, and named for the mambises, Cuban independence fighters of the 19th century.[62] Suárez had arrived in Florida penniless as a 19-year-old, with interests in home construction and the manufacture of watches and telephone answering machines.[63]\n\nEven before full FCC approval of the underlying transfers, the merger of WGBS into WNWS became effective at noon on October 23, 1985,[64] when the call letters WGBS disappeared from Miami radio after 40 years to make way for WAQI. Temporary studios on SW 67th Avenue were used to start Radio Mambí while permanent facilities on Coral Way were built. Much like its direct format competitors—WQBA (1180 AM), WOCN (1450 AM) "Unión Radio", and WRHC (1550 AM)—Radio Mambí provided primarily news and talk programming alongside soap operas and music.[65] Unión Radio was raided heavily by the new WAQI and lost several popular personalities to the startup.[66]\n\nOne of the most attractive characteristics of the 710 facility to Mambisa was the physical plant. Whereas Jefferson-Pilot, competing for English-language listeners, wanted a signal with better Broward coverage, Mambisa got a bonus of import to its work: one of the best Miami signals into Cuba.[66][62] This fact was not lost on the Cuban government. Four days after the changeover to Radio Mambí, transmissions started for Radio Rebelde, one of Cuba\'s national radio stations, on transmitters on 710 kHz, as Radio Mambí entered what general manager Armando Pérez Roura called "a radio war with Castro" designed to block its anti-government programs from being heard in Cuba.[67] One transmitter at Santa Clara aired Rebelde, and another at Havana was noted as emitting a "high-frequency jamming buzz".[68] Rebelde The irony was that the main interference generated was not within Cuba, where station officials claimed to have a large audience, but in Florida, where high-power Radio Rebelde and WQBA signals clashed.[67] When WAQI was audible in Cuba, it offered an opposition viewpoint that reestablished contact between Cuban exiles and Cuba itself.[69]\n\nRadio Mambí rapidly became a popular station with the heavily Cuban Spanish-speaking audience in Miami by becoming the station of Cuba\'s exile community, close to the families of political prisoners and organized opposition movements while offering community service and cultural programming.[69] Suárez expanded into television with HBC, which produced the fledgling Telemundo network\'s first nightly newscast in January 1987 from Miami,[63] and, through another company, he bought FM station WTHM (98.3) in 1987[70] to relaunch it as WRTO-FM "Ritmo 98", the second full-time Spanish-language FM station in the city.[71][72]\n\nIn 1992, Radio Martí began to purchase an hour of airtime each night on WAQI and WQBA to broadcast programming to Cuba, utilizing a 1983 clause in the law that created Radio Martí permitting broadcasts over commercial stations if jamming had increased by 25 percent or more.[73] By 2007, Radio Mambí was being paid $182,500 every six months to broadcast the Radio Martí program.[74]\nOn June 3, 2022, Univision announced it would sell a package of 18 radio stations across 10 of its markets, primarily AM outlets in large cities (including WAQI and WQBA) and entire clusters in smaller markets such as McAllen, Texas, and Fresno, California, for $60 million to a new company known as Latino Media Network (LMN); Univision proposes to handle operations for a year under agreement before turning over operational control to LMN in the fourth quarter of 2023.[86]\n\nThe deal was immediately interpreted in a political context. Latino Media Network is headed by Stephanie Valencia, who headed Latino outreach for Barack Obama, and Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic activist, with investors and advisors including Eva Longoria, former Florida Republican Party chair Al Cárdenas, longtime television anchor María Elena Salinas, and former Miami-Dade College president Eduardo J. Padrón. Much of its funding comes from Lakestar Capital, associated with businessman and philanthropist George Soros.[87][88] Other Democratic groups had noted the prevalence of disinformation and antisemitism and the promotion of conspiracy theories, including the Great Replacement, on its air.[89] This was particularly well received by older listeners, loyal to stations like WAQI.[90] A 2021 report by media watchdogs, which focused on programs on Radio Mambí and WURN "Actualidad Radio" during one week in March 2021,[91] cited practices such as hosts not correcting callers\' incorrect statements, as well as recitations of false claims as news using sources such as Newsmax and The Daily Caller.[92] A former Univision executive told Graciela Mochkofsky of The New Yorker that Mambí\'s content was often "indefensible".[93]\n\nConservative political actors immediately feared that the change in ownership would lead to programming changes, particularly at Radio Mambí, that would marginalize their point of view. The head of Mothers Against Repression, Sylvia Iriondo, announced at a press conference held by the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, "We have grounds to be extremely concerned [...] We will resist any attempt to censor the voices of this community represented by these radio stations with all legal and legitimate means".[94] Other speakers included Florida lieutenant governor Jeanette Núñez, who recalled growing up listening to Radio Mambí in the car.[95] Six Republican lawmakers, five of them from the Florida delegation—senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, representatives Carlos A. Giménez, María Elvira Salazar, and Mario Díaz-Balart, as well as senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas—wrote a letter to FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel urging it to "thoroughly scrutinize" the transaction when filed and casting it as a "desperate" move by Democratic operatives, noting their concern over a proposed sale of WSUA (1260 AM) to ATV Holdings, which had fallen apart earlier that year.[96][97] The re-election campaign of Republican governor Ron DeSantis bought advertising time on WAQI and WQBA ($6,525 of it on WAQI[98]), airing 60-second commercials warning voters, "The left is taking control of our local media" and "they are coming with their ideological agenda", mentioning Soros "and his minions".[99] In an op-ed in the Miami Herald, Valencia and Morales Rocketto wrote of their commitment to free speech and free markets, noting that they "do not intend to change the spirit or character of what has made it popular and profitable".[100] However, several hosts departed the station, including Dania Alexandrino, Lourdes Ubieta, and Nelson Rubio, to start a new online radio station known as Americano Media, which promises to start the "first Spanish-language conservative talk radio network"; Ubieta claimed that Univision offered them and other presenters a bonus worth thousands of dollars in exchange for staying and signing a confidentiality agreement, which Pérez Castellón, who stayed, denied.[101]'

Storer, for $275,000; Storer would move the station on a full-time basis to Miami,[5] where he owned a home in Surfside.[13] The FCC slated the transaction for hearing, during which time it was revealed that Fort Industry was keeping the station afloat while the transaction was pending.[14]\r\nThe FCC approved of the sale on February 29, 1944, and work began to move the station\'s operations to Miami on a full-time basis.[12] However, several legal concerns and even questions before a House committee investigating the FCC were raised over two issues: the fact that the same attorney, Andrew Bennett, worked for both Horton and Storer, and allegations that FCC chairman James Lawrence Fly had accepted a $17.30 gratuity from Storer to pay for a stay at an Atlanta hotel.[15] Fly denied having any influence with regard to the sale of WFTL.[16] John Sirica, serving as counsel to the House committee, declared that there had been a conspiracy by Fly, Storer, Bennett and others to obtain WFTL.[17] An editorial in the Fort Lauderdale Daily News pointed out Horton\'s admitted lack of expertise, quipping that "he didn\'t know a kilocycle from a station-break and he admitted it" and noting that Horton had entered into a refinancing contract that was an unauthorized transfer of control.[18] A final statement from the committee, released at the start of 1945, chided Fly for "putting the heat on" to pressure Horton to sell, declared Bennett\'s actions to be a "double-crossing" of Horton, and found the sale price "entirely too low" in view of WFTL\'s business prospects.[19]\r\nIn December 1944, WFTL announced it would leave Mutual on June 15, 1945, to join the Blue Network, replacing WKAT (1360 AM).[20] Prior to the change in network affiliation, the station dropped the WFTL designation and took Storer\'s initials as its own, becoming WGBS on April 16.[21][2] WGBS and WQAM exchanged network affiliations in 1947, with WGBS picking up the CBS affiliation,[22] as part of a group deal that also gave affiliation to Fort Industry\'s WWVA in Wheeling, West Virginia, and WAGA in Atlanta.[23] The FCC approved a daytime power increase to 50,000 watts in 1947, and work was completed in January 1949,[2] making WGBS the first 50,000-watt station in Florida.[24] In 1952, the Fort Industry Company, named prior to owning radio and television properties, changed its name to Storer Broadcasting Company.[25]\r\nIn 1948, an FM radio station was launched primarily to simulcast WGBS\'s AM transmission, as WGBS-FM.[26] However, by 1957, it was operating just six hours a day, six days a week.[27]\r\n\r\nStorer had been attempting to enter Miami television, but ownership limit complications complicated its path until Storer was able to buy a UHF television station, WFTL-TV (channel 23), in 1954, the same year it moved its corporate offices to Miami Beach.[a][28] Like with WFTL radio a decade before, Storer moved the station to Miami as WGBS-TV.[29] After losing the NBC affiliation to new VHF station WCKT (channel 7) in 1956, WGBS-TV continued for a year as an independent before shutting down on April 13, 1957, and selling its physical plant to Public Service Television, which was preparing to put WPST-TV (channel 10) on the air;[30][31] Storer declared it to have never been profitable.[32]\r\nCBS Radio\'s elimination of the bulk of its entertainment programming on November 28, 1960,[33] spurred WGBS to disaffiliate from the network and become an independent.[34] Likewise, WGBS adopted a beautiful music/middle of the road format similar to one successfully implemented by co-owned WJW in Cleveland, Ohio, earlier in the year.[35] To assist the 10-person news department, WGBS established or arranged for international news bureaus throughout Europe and Asia, along with bureaus in the U.S.[36] In October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, WGBS\'s high power became of utility to the federal government. It requisitioned airtime on WGBS, WCKR (the former WIOD), and WMIE for three weeks to broadcast Spanish-language Voice of America output to Cuba at night; during this time, normal WGBS programs were heard only on FM.[37] In November, this was relaxed after VOA built its own station at Marathon, though WGBS still continued to air three hours a day of VOA output at night.[38]\r\n\r\nIn 1964, Storer made a $1 million investment in WGBS. It built a new transmitter site in South Broward, allowing it to raise its nighttime power to 50,000 watts, and a new, colonial-style office building was constructed at 710 Brickell Avenue, leaving the Mayfair after 20 years.[39] The 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) building opened in December 1965;[40] Storer commissioned a custom song, "Make Ours Miami", to mark the occasion, and local governments declared "WGBS Week" in Miami.[41] Arnie Warren, formerly of WKAT, joined WGBS in 1966 and would serve as its morning man for 13 years.[42] By this time, the station was cemented as an adult contemporary outlet.[43] WGBS-FM also saw an upgrade: Storer repurchased the former WGBS-TV transmission tower from Public Service Television (whose license for WPST-TV had been revoked by the FCC)[44] to help enable a power upgrade to 100,000 watts.[45] The station broadcast the Miami Floridians of the American Basketball Association for three of their four seasons of existence, taking over from WOCN (1450 AM) in 1969.[46]\r\n\r\nStorer renamed WGBS-FM as WJHR, in honor of Storer Broadcasting co-founder J. Harold Ryan, in 1969,[47] then sold off both it and their Detroit FM outlet in 1970 to Bartell Broadcasters.[48] Storer would return to FM by buying WLYF (101.5 FM) from Sudbrink Communications for $5.56 million in early 1978.[49]\r\nStorer opted to exit radio entirely in late 1978 and began to find buyers for its radio properties, using the profits to invest further in cable TV systems.[50][51] Storer asked $14 million for its Miami radio operation, but WGBS and WLYF-FM were ultimately sold for $12.5 million to Jefferson-Pilot Communications in February 1979;[52] the FCC approved of the transaction that December.[2] The stations moved in 1982 to studios in North Dade, allowing Jefferson-Pilot to sell the Brickell studios to Northern Trust Bank of Florida in what marked a record for a property sale on that major thoroughfare.[53] (The building, last used by the Miami Today newspaper, was demolished in 2013.[54])\r\n\r\nRatings for the adult contemporary format declined during Jefferson-Pilot ownership as music listening continued to shift to FM, and WGBS was the last station to broadcast such a format on the AM dial.[55] In February 1983, WGBS switched to a news/talk format, with hosts including David Gold and Mike Siegel.[56] However, ratings were low throughout the run as three other stations battled it out with WGBS in that format, and by mid-1984, it was attracting ratings comparable to its prior adult contemporary sound with higher programming costs, though it was making a profit.[57]\r\nIn July 1985, Jefferson-Pilot announced it would purchase one of the direct competitors to WGBS, WNWS (790 AM), with its superior signal in Broward County and stronger ratings.[59][60] The stations worked toward a merger in November, in which four WNWS hosts and two from WGBS headed the new WNWS talk lineup.[61]\r\n\r\nBecause at the time no company could own multiple AM stations in the same area, the WGBS facility and license—though not the studios—was sold to the Mambisa Broadcasting Corporation for $3.5 million.[59] Mambisa was headed by Amancio Víctor Suárez, a 49-year-old self-made millionaire with no broadcast experience, and named for the mambises, Cuban independence fighters of the 19th century.[62] Suárez had arrived in Florida penniless as a 19-year-old, with interests in home construction and the manufacture of watches and telephone answering machines.[63]\r\n\r\nEven before full FCC approval of the underlying transfers, the merger of WGBS into WNWS became effective at noon on October 23, 1985,[64] when the call letters WGBS disappeared from Miami radio after 40 years to make way for WAQI. Temporary studios on SW 67th Avenue were used to start Radio Mambí while permanent facilities on Coral Way were built. Much like its direct format competitors—WQBA (1180 AM), WOCN (1450 AM) "Unión Radio", and WRHC (1550 AM)—Radio Mambí provided primarily news and talk programming alongside soap operas and music.[65] Unión Radio was raided heavily by the new WAQI and lost several popular personalities to the startup.[66]\r\n\r\nOne of the most attractive characteristics of the 710 facility to Mambisa was the physical plant. Whereas Jefferson-Pilot, competing for English-language listeners, wanted a signal with better Broward coverage, Mambisa got a bonus of import to its work: one of the best Miami signals into Cuba.[66][62] This fact was not lost on the Cuban government. Four days after the changeover to Radio Mambí, transmissions started for Radio Rebelde, one of Cuba\'s national radio stations, on transmitters on 710 kHz, as Radio Mambí entered what general manager Armando Pérez Roura called "a radio war with Castro" designed to block its anti-government programs from being heard in Cuba.[67] One transmitter at Santa Clara aired Rebelde, and another at Havana was noted as emitting a "high-frequency jamming buzz".[68] Rebelde The irony was that the main interference generated was not within Cuba, where station officials claimed to have a large audience, but in Florida, where high-power Radio Rebelde and WQBA signals clashed.[67] When WAQI was audible in Cuba, it offered an opposition viewpoint that reestablished contact between Cuban exiles and Cuba itself.[69]\r\n\r\nRadio Mambí rapidly became a popular station with the heavily Cuban Spanish-speaking audience in Miami by becoming the station of Cuba\'s exile community, close to the families of political prisoners and organized opposition movements while offering community service and cultural programming.[69] Suárez expanded into television with HBC, which produced the fledgling Telemundo network\'s first nightly newscast in January 1987 from Miami,[63] and, through another company, he bought FM station WTHM (98.3) in 1987[70] to relaunch it as WRTO-FM "Ritmo 98", the second full-time Spanish-language FM station in the city.[71][72]\r\n\r\nIn 1992, Radio Martí began to purchase an hour of airtime each night on WAQI and WQBA to broadcast programming to Cuba, utilizing a 1983 clause in the law that created Radio Martí permitting broadcasts over commercial stations if jamming had increased by 25 percent or more.[73] By 2007, Radio Mambí was being paid $182,500 every six months to broadcast the Radio Martí program.[74]\r\nOn June 3, 2022, Univision announced it would sell a package of 18 radio stations across 10 of its markets, primarily AM outlets in large cities (including WAQI and WQBA) and entire clusters in smaller markets such as McAllen, Texas, and Fresno, California, for $60 million to a new company known as Latino Media Network (LMN); Univision proposes to handle operations for a year under agreement before turning over operational control to LMN in the fourth quarter of 2023.[86]\r\n\r\nThe deal was immediately interpreted in a political context. Latino Media Network is headed by Stephanie Valencia, who headed Latino outreach for Barack Obama, and Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic activist, with investors and advisors including Eva Longoria, former Florida Republican Party chair Al Cárdenas, longtime television anchor María Elena Salinas, and former Miami-Dade College president Eduardo J. Padrón. Much of its funding comes from Lakestar Capital, associated with businessman and philanthropist George Soros.[87][88] Other Democratic groups had noted the prevalence of disinformation and antisemitism and the promotion of conspiracy theories, including the Great Replacement, on its air.[89] This was particularly well received by older listeners, loyal to stations like WAQI.[90] A 2021 report by media watchdogs, which focused on programs on Radio Mambí and WURN "Actualidad Radio" during one week in March 2021,[91] cited practices such as hosts not correcting callers\' incorrect statements, as well as recitations of false claims as news using sources such as Newsmax and The Daily Caller.[92] A former Univision executive told Graciela Mochkofsky of The New Yorker that Mambí\'s content was often "indefensible".[93]\r\n\r\nConservative political actors immediately feared that the change in ownership would lead to programming changes, particularly at Radio Mambí, that would marginalize their point of view. The head of Mothers Against Repression, Sylvia Iriondo, announced at a press conference held by the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, "We have grounds to be extremely concerned [...] We will resist any attempt to censor the voices of this community represented by these radio stations with all legal and legitimate means".[94] Other speakers included Florida lieutenant governor Jeanette Núñez, who recalled growing up listening to Radio Mambí in the car.[95] Six Republican lawmakers, five of them from the Florida delegation—senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, representatives Carlos A. Giménez, María Elvira Salazar, and Mario Díaz-Balart, as well as senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas—wrote a letter to FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel urging it to "thoroughly scrutinize" the transaction when filed and casting it as a "desperate" move by Democratic operatives, noting their concern over a proposed sale of WSUA (1260 AM) to ATV Holdings, which had fallen apart earlier that year.[96][97] The re-election campaign of Republican governor Ron DeSantis bought advertising time on WAQI and WQBA ($6,525 of it on WAQI[98]), airing 60-second commercials warning voters, "The left is taking control of our local media" and "they are coming with their ideological agenda", mentioning Soros "and his minions".[99] In an op-ed in the Miami Herald, Valencia and Morales Rocketto wrote of their commitment to free speech and free markets, noting that they "do not intend to change the spirit or character of what has made it popular and profitable".[100] However, several hosts departed the station, including Dania Alexandrino, Lourdes Ubieta, and Nelson Rubio, to start a new online radio station known as Americano Media, which promises to start the "first Spanish-language conservative talk radio network"; Ubieta claimed that Univision offered them and other presenters a bonus worth thousands of dollars in exchange for staying and signing a confidentiality agreement, which Pérez Castellón, who stayed, denied.[101]'

It requisitioned airtime on WGBS, WCKR (the former WIOD), and WMIE for three weeks to broadcast Spanish-language Voice of America output to Cuba at night; during this time, normal WGBS programs were heard only on FM.[37]", 'Suárez expanded into television with HBC, which produced the fledgling Telemundo network\'s first nightly newscast in January 1987 from Miami,[63] and, through another company, he bought FM station WTHM (98.3) in 1987[70] to relaunch it as WRTO-FM "Ritmo 98", the second full-time Spanish-language FM station in the city.[71][72] By 2007, Radio Mambí was being paid $182,500 every six months to broadcast the Radio Martí program.[74]', 'It built a new transmitter site in South Broward, allowing it to raise its nighttime power to 50,000 watts, and a new, colonial-style office building was constructed at 710 Brickell Avenue, leaving the Mayfair after 20 years.[39] The 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) building opened in December 1965;[40]', 'A final statement from the committee, released at the start of 1945, chided Fly for "putting the heat on" to pressure Horton to sell, declared Bennett\'s actions to be a "double-crossing" of Horton, and found the sale price "entirely too low" in view of WFTL\'s business prospects.[19] In December 1944, WFTL announced it would leave Mutual on June 15, 1945, to join the Blue Network, replacing WKAT (1360 AM).[20]', 'However, by 1957, it was operating just six hours a day, six days a week.[27] Storer had been attempting to enter Miami television, but ownership limit complications complicated its path until Storer was able to buy a UHF television station, WFTL-TV (channel 23), in 1954, the same year it moved its corporate offices to Miami Beach.[a][28]', 'In July 1985, Jefferson-Pilot announced it would purchase one of the direct competitors to WGBS, WNWS (790 AM), with its superior signal in Broward County and stronger ratings.[59][60] Because at the time no company could own multiple AM stations in the same area, the WGBS facility and license—though not the studios—was sold to the Mambisa Broadcasting Corporation for $3.5 million.[59]']), ('questions', ['What does Radio Mamb<unk> serve as?', "What company did Suarez work with to produce the Telemundo network's first nightly newscast?", 'How much did Univision pay for the package of 18 stations in 2022?', 'When did the FCC approve the move?', 'Who was the founder of Storer Broadcasting?', 'What bank bought the Brickell studios in 1982?', 'Where did Storer move WFTL?', 'When did Radio Mart<unk> begin to purchase airtime?', 'Who was the general manager of Radio Mamb<unk>?', 'When did the merger of WGBS and WNWS become effective?', 'What was the name of the new station that replaced WGBS-TV?', 'When was work completed on WGBS?', 'Who filed for a permit to build a new radio station in Fort Lauderdale?', 'Where was the new transmitter site built?', 'When were WGBS and WLYF-FM sold to Jefferson-Pilot Communications?', 'What was the broadcast frequency of WNWS?', 'Where was WGBS headquartered?', 'When did WFTL begin broadcasting?', 'What station was slated to join the Mutual Broadcasting System?', 'What station did Jefferson-Pilot sell in 1985?', 'When did Jefferson-Pilot Communications convert WGBS to talk format?', "What is WAQI's AM station?", 'What stations did WGBS requisition airtime on?', 'How much was Radio Mamb<unk> paid every six months?', 'When did the 10,000-square-foot building open?', 'When did WFTL announce it would leave Mutual?', 'When did Storer buy a television station?', 'What company purchased the WGBS facility and license?']), ('answers', ["South Florida's designated primary entry point for the Emergency Alert System", 'HBC', '60 million', 'January 6, 1942', 'J.

ERROR:root:payload: 'Neural Network in 3 minutes | Deep Learning for DummiesWAQI (710 AM) is a commercial radio station licensed to Miami, Florida, United States, featuring a Spanish-language talk format known as Radio Mambí. Currently owned by Uforia Audio Network, the radio division of TelevisaUnivision, the station broadcasts at 50,000 watts during the day and 6,300 watts at night and serves as South Florida\'s designated primary entry point for the Emergency Alert System, one of three in the state.[1] The studios are located at Univision\'s Miami headquarters, and the transmitter is located at the intersection of U.S. 41 and Florida State Road 997, near the edge of the Everglades.\n\nThe history of today\'s WAQI begins with the establishment of WFTL in Fort Lauderdale in 1939. The tiny local station raised its profile by switching to its present frequency in 1943 and becoming the highest-power station in Florida at the time. It was acquired by George B. Storer in 1944 after a controversial acquisition that resulted in government scrutiny, moving to Miami the next year. WGBS grew into a 50,000-watt station, and Storer became headquartered in Miami, starting first an FM station and an ill-fated TV station. It generally aired an adult music format after the 1950s. When Storer opted to exit radio at the end of 1978, Jefferson-Pilot Communications purchased its Miami radio properties, converting the low-rated WGBS to a talk format in February 1983.\n\nIn 1985, Jefferson-Pilot sold WGBS to buy WNWS (790 AM), then its direct competitor, merging the two stations\' programming on the 790 frequency that had a better signal into Broward County. The 710 facility, with its strong signal into Cuba, was then spun off to Cuban-American businessman Amancio Suárez, resulting in the foundation of WAQI Radio Mambí. Known for its hardline anticommunist stance from the start, Mambí has ranked among the most popular Spanish-language stations in South Florida and is also jammed by the Cuban government; however, it has also been criticized for disseminating disinformation, particularly by groups on the left. Sales of Radio Mambí in 1994 and 2022 have attracted attention in political circles.\nOn January 10, 1939, Tom M. Bryan filed for a construction permit to build a new local radio station to serve Fort Lauderdale on the frequency of 1370 kHz, with 250 watts during the day and 100 at night.[2] The Federal Communications Commission granted Bryan the permit on July 12, 1939, and on December 3, 1939, WFTL made its first broadcasts from studios and a transmitter site on Andrews Avenue.[3] Bryan had brought other pioneering local businesses to Lauderdale prior to building WFTL; these included the city\'s first ice plant and telephone company.[4] The station upgraded nighttime power to 250 watts in 1940 and moved to 1400 kHz in 1941 with the frequency changes of NARBA.[2]\n\nIn February 1941, Bryan filed to sell WFTL to Ralph A. Horton. While there was concern that the association of Horton with a local newspaper, the morning Fort Lauderdale Times,[5] could block the sale,[6] the FCC approved on July 1.[2] Within months of Horton acquiring WFTL, the station joined the Mutual Broadcasting System, becoming the closest Mutual station to Miami,[7] and in October, Horton filed to move to 710 kHz and increase power to 10,000 watts from a new transmitter site west of the city, which the FCC approved on January 6, 1942.[2] At the time, one Miami station (WIOD) broadcast with 5,000 watts, and a second, WQAM, was slated to join it.[8] Materials restrictions associated with the outbreak of World War II slowed work, but by late 1942, the building expansion had been completed, as had the necessary three-tower array.[9] Not only was the station increasing its power to become the largest in Florida, it announced it would set up Miami studios in the Mayfair Theater, quarters originally used by the Miami Conservatory of Music.[10]\n\nThe upgrade and new frequency took effect on February 24, 1943, bringing a full-power Mutual signal to Miami.[11]\nTwo months after activating the 10,000-watt facility and new Miami studios, Horton—later citing his lack of knowledge of the radio business[12]—announced he would sell WFTL to the Fort Industry Company, led by George B. Storer, for $275,000; Storer would move the station on a full-time basis to Miami,[5] where he owned a home in Surfside.[13] The FCC slated the transaction for hearing, during which time it was revealed that Fort Industry was keeping the station afloat while the transaction was pending.[14]\nThe FCC approved of the sale on February 29, 1944, and work began to move the station\'s operations to Miami on a full-time basis.[12] However, several legal concerns and even questions before a House committee investigating the FCC were raised over two issues: the fact that the same attorney, Andrew Bennett, worked for both Horton and Storer, and allegations that FCC chairman James Lawrence Fly had accepted a $17.30 gratuity from Storer to pay for a stay at an Atlanta hotel.[15] Fly denied having any influence with regard to the sale of WFTL.[16] John Sirica, serving as counsel to the House committee, declared that there had been a conspiracy by Fly, Storer, Bennett and others to obtain WFTL.[17] An editorial in the Fort Lauderdale Daily News pointed out Horton\'s admitted lack of expertise, quipping that "he didn\'t know a kilocycle from a station-break and he admitted it" and noting that Horton had entered into a refinancing contract that was an unauthorized transfer of control.[18] A final statement from the committee, released at the start of 1945, chided Fly for "putting the heat on" to pressure Horton to sell, declared Bennett\'s actions to be a "double-crossing" of Horton, and found the sale price "entirely too low" in view of WFTL\'s business prospects.[19]\nIn December 1944, WFTL announced it would leave Mutual on June 15, 1945, to join the Blue Network, replacing WKAT (1360 AM).[20] Prior to the change in network affiliation, the station dropped the WFTL designation and took Storer\'s initials as its own, becoming WGBS on April 16.[21][2] WGBS and WQAM exchanged network affiliations in 1947, with WGBS picking up the CBS affiliation,[22] as part of a group deal that also gave affiliation to Fort Industry\'s WWVA in Wheeling, West Virginia, and WAGA in Atlanta.[23] The FCC approved a daytime power increase to 50,000 watts in 1947, and work was completed in January 1949,[2] making WGBS the first 50,000-watt station in Florida.[24] In 1952, the Fort Industry Company, named prior to owning radio and television properties, changed its name to Storer Broadcasting Company.[25]\nIn 1948, an FM radio station was launched primarily to simulcast WGBS\'s AM transmission, as WGBS-FM.[26] However, by 1957, it was operating just six hours a day, six days a week.[27]\n\nStorer had been attempting to enter Miami television, but ownership limit complications complicated its path until Storer was able to buy a UHF television station, WFTL-TV (channel 23), in 1954, the same year it moved its corporate offices to Miami Beach.[a][28] Like with WFTL radio a decade before, Storer moved the station to Miami as WGBS-TV.[29] After losing the NBC affiliation to new VHF station WCKT (channel 7) in 1956, WGBS-TV continued for a year as an independent before shutting down on April 13, 1957, and selling its physical plant to Public Service Television, which was preparing to put WPST-TV (channel 10) on the air;[30][31] Storer declared it to have never been profitable.[32]\nCBS Radio\'s elimination of the bulk of its entertainment programming on November 28, 1960,[33] spurred WGBS to disaffiliate from the network and become an independent.[34] Likewise, WGBS adopted a beautiful music/middle of the road format similar to one successfully implemented by co-owned WJW in Cleveland, Ohio, earlier in the year.[35] To assist the 10-person news department, WGBS established or arranged for international news bureaus throughout Europe and Asia, along with bureaus in the U.S.[36] In October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, WGBS\'s high power became of utility to the federal government. It requisitioned airtime on WGBS, WCKR (the former WIOD), and WMIE for three weeks to broadcast Spanish-language Voice of America output to Cuba at night; during this time, normal WGBS programs were heard only on FM.[37] In November, this was relaxed after VOA built its own station at Marathon, though WGBS still continued to air three hours a day of VOA output at night.[38]\n\nIn 1964, Storer made a $1 million investment in WGBS. It built a new transmitter site in South Broward, allowing it to raise its nighttime power to 50,000 watts, and a new, colonial-style office building was constructed at 710 Brickell Avenue, leaving the Mayfair after 20 years.[39] The 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) building opened in December 1965;[40] Storer commissioned a custom song, "Make Ours Miami", to mark the occasion, and local governments declared "WGBS Week" in Miami.[41] Arnie Warren, formerly of WKAT, joined WGBS in 1966 and would serve as its morning man for 13 years.[42] By this time, the station was cemented as an adult contemporary outlet.[43] WGBS-FM also saw an upgrade: Storer repurchased the former WGBS-TV transmission tower from Public Service Television (whose license for WPST-TV had been revoked by the FCC)[44] to help enable a power upgrade to 100,000 watts.[45] The station broadcast the Miami Floridians of the American Basketball Association for three of their four seasons of existence, taking over from WOCN (1450 AM) in 1969.[46]\n\nStorer renamed WGBS-FM as WJHR, in honor of Storer Broadcasting co-founder J. Harold Ryan, in 1969,[47] then sold off both it and their Detroit FM outlet in 1970 to Bartell Broadcasters.[48] Storer would return to FM by buying WLYF (101.5 FM) from Sudbrink Communications for $5.56 million in early 1978.[49]\nStorer opted to exit radio entirely in late 1978 and began to find buyers for its radio properties, using the profits to invest further in cable TV systems.[50][51] Storer asked $14 million for its Miami radio operation, but WGBS and WLYF-FM were ultimately sold for $12.5 million to Jefferson-Pilot Communications in February 1979;[52] the FCC approved of the transaction that December.[2] The stations moved in 1982 to studios in North Dade, allowing Jefferson-Pilot to sell the Brickell studios to Northern Trust Bank of Florida in what marked a record for a property sale on that major thoroughfare.[53] (The building, last used by the Miami Today newspaper, was demolished in 2013.[54])\n\nRatings for the adult contemporary format declined during Jefferson-Pilot ownership as music listening continued to shift to FM, and WGBS was the last station to broadcast such a format on the AM dial.[55] In February 1983, WGBS switched to a news/talk format, with hosts including David Gold and Mike Siegel.[56] However, ratings were low throughout the run as three other stations battled it out with WGBS in that format, and by mid-1984, it was attracting ratings comparable to its prior adult contemporary sound with higher programming costs, though it was making a profit.[57]\nIn July 1985, Jefferson-Pilot announced it would purchase one of the direct competitors to WGBS, WNWS (790 AM), with its superior signal in Broward County and stronger ratings.[59][60] The stations worked toward a merger in November, in which four WNWS hosts and two from WGBS headed the new WNWS talk lineup.[61]\n\nBecause at the time no company could own multiple AM stations in the same area, the WGBS facility and license—though not the studios—was sold to the Mambisa Broadcasting Corporation for $3.5 million.[59] Mambisa was headed by Amancio Víctor Suárez, a 49-year-old self-made millionaire with no broadcast experience, and named for the mambises, Cuban independence fighters of the 19th century.[62] Suárez had arrived in Florida penniless as a 19-year-old, with interests in home construction and the manufacture of watches and telephone answering machines.[63]\n\nEven before full FCC approval of the underlying transfers, the merger of WGBS into WNWS became effective at noon on October 23, 1985,[64] when the call letters WGBS disappeared from Miami radio after 40 years to make way for WAQI. Temporary studios on SW 67th Avenue were used to start Radio Mambí while permanent facilities on Coral Way were built. Much like its direct format competitors—WQBA (1180 AM), WOCN (1450 AM) "Unión Radio", and WRHC (1550 AM)—Radio Mambí provided primarily news and talk programming alongside soap operas and music.[65] Unión Radio was raided heavily by the new WAQI and lost several popular personalities to the startup.[66]\n\nOne of the most attractive characteristics of the 710 facility to Mambisa was the physical plant. Whereas Jefferson-Pilot, competing for English-language listeners, wanted a signal with better Broward coverage, Mambisa got a bonus of import to its work: one of the best Miami signals into Cuba.[66][62] This fact was not lost on the Cuban government. Four days after the changeover to Radio Mambí, transmissions started for Radio Rebelde, one of Cuba\'s national radio stations, on transmitters on 710 kHz, as Radio Mambí entered what general manager Armando Pérez Roura called "a radio war with Castro" designed to block its anti-government programs from being heard in Cuba.[67] One transmitter at Santa Clara aired Rebelde, and another at Havana was noted as emitting a "high-frequency jamming buzz".[68] Rebelde The irony was that the main interference generated was not within Cuba, where station officials claimed to have a large audience, but in Florida, where high-power Radio Rebelde and WQBA signals clashed.[67] When WAQI was audible in Cuba, it offered an opposition viewpoint that reestablished contact between Cuban exiles and Cuba itself.[69]\n\nRadio Mambí rapidly became a popular station with the heavily Cuban Spanish-speaking audience in Miami by becoming the station of Cuba\'s exile community, close to the families of political prisoners and organized opposition movements while offering community service and cultural programming.[69] Suárez expanded into television with HBC, which produced the fledgling Telemundo network\'s first nightly newscast in January 1987 from Miami,[63] and, through another company, he bought FM station WTHM (98.3) in 1987[70] to relaunch it as WRTO-FM "Ritmo 98", the second full-time Spanish-language FM station in the city.[71][72]\n\nIn 1992, Radio Martí began to purchase an hour of airtime each night on WAQI and WQBA to broadcast programming to Cuba, utilizing a 1983 clause in the law that created Radio Martí permitting broadcasts over commercial stations if jamming had increased by 25 percent or more.[73] By 2007, Radio Mambí was being paid $182,500 every six months to broadcast the Radio Martí program.[74]\nOn June 3, 2022, Univision announced it would sell a package of 18 radio stations across 10 of its markets, primarily AM outlets in large cities (including WAQI and WQBA) and entire clusters in smaller markets such as McAllen, Texas, and Fresno, California, for $60 million to a new company known as Latino Media Network (LMN); Univision proposes to handle operations for a year under agreement before turning over operational control to LMN in the fourth quarter of 2023.[86]\n\nThe deal was immediately interpreted in a political context. Latino Media Network is headed by Stephanie Valencia, who headed Latino outreach for Barack Obama, and Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic activist, with investors and advisors including Eva Longoria, former Florida Republican Party chair Al Cárdenas, longtime television anchor María Elena Salinas, and former Miami-Dade College president Eduardo J. Padrón. Much of its funding comes from Lakestar Capital, associated with businessman and philanthropist George Soros.[87][88] Other Democratic groups had noted the prevalence of disinformation and antisemitism and the promotion of conspiracy theories, including the Great Replacement, on its air.[89] This was particularly well received by older listeners, loyal to stations like WAQI.[90] A 2021 report by media watchdogs, which focused on programs on Radio Mambí and WURN "Actualidad Radio" during one week in March 2021,[91] cited practices such as hosts not correcting callers\' incorrect statements, as well as recitations of false claims as news using sources such as Newsmax and The Daily Caller.[92] A former Univision executive told Graciela Mochkofsky of The New Yorker that Mambí\'s content was often "indefensible".[93]\n\nConservative political actors immediately feared that the change in ownership would lead to programming changes, particularly at Radio Mambí, that would marginalize their point of view. The head of Mothers Against Repression, Sylvia Iriondo, announced at a press conference held by the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, "We have grounds to be extremely concerned [...] We will resist any attempt to censor the voices of this community represented by these radio stations with all legal and legitimate means".[94] Other speakers included Florida lieutenant governor Jeanette Núñez, who recalled growing up listening to Radio Mambí in the car.[95] Six Republican lawmakers, five of them from the Florida delegation—senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, representatives Carlos A. Giménez, María Elvira Salazar, and Mario Díaz-Balart, as well as senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas—wrote a letter to FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel urging it to "thoroughly scrutinize" the transaction when filed and casting it as a "desperate" move by Democratic operatives, noting their concern over a proposed sale of WSUA (1260 AM) to ATV Holdings, which had fallen apart earlier that year.[96][97] The re-election campaign of Republican governor Ron DeSantis bought advertising time on WAQI and WQBA ($6,525 of it on WAQI[98]), airing 60-second commercials warning voters, "The left is taking control of our local media" and "they are coming with their ideological agenda", mentioning Soros "and his minions".[99] In an op-ed in the Miami Herald, Valencia and Morales Rocketto wrote of their commitment to free speech and free markets, noting that they "do not intend to change the spirit or character of what has made it popular and profitable".[100] However, several hosts departed the station, including Dania Alexandrino, Lourdes Ubieta, and Nelson Rubio, to start a new online radio station known as Americano Media, which promises to start the "first Spanish-language conservative talk radio network"; Ubieta claimed that Univision offered them and other presenters a bonus worth thousands of dollars in exchange for staying and signing a confidentiality agreement, which Pérez Castellón, who stayed, denied.[101]Viki A.

ERROR:root:orig input: 'Neural Network in 3 minutes | Deep Learning for DummiesWAQI (710 AM) is a commercial radio station licensed to Miami, Florida, United States, featuring a Spanish-language talk format known as Radio Mambí. Currently owned by Uforia Audio Network, the radio division of TelevisaUnivision, the station broadcasts at 50,000 watts during the day and 6,300 watts at night and serves as South Florida\'s designated primary entry point for the Emergency Alert System, one of three in the state.[1] The studios are located at Univision\'s Miami headquarters, and the transmitter is located at the intersection of U.S. 41 and Florida State Road 997, near the edge of the Everglades.\r\n\r\nThe history of today\'s WAQI begins with the establishment of WFTL in Fort Lauderdale in 1939.

Harold Ryan, in 1969,[47] then sold off both it and their Detroit FM outlet in 1970 to Bartell Broadcasters.[48] Storer would return to FM by buying WLYF (101.5 FM) from Sudbrink Communications for $5.56 million in early 1978.[49]\r\nStorer opted to exit radio entirely in late 1978 and began to find buyers for its radio properties, using the profits to invest further in cable TV systems.[50][51] Storer asked $14 million for its Miami radio operation, but WGBS and WLYF-FM were ultimately sold for $12.5 million to Jefferson-Pilot Communications in February 1979;[52] the FCC approved of the transaction that December.[2] The stations moved in 1982 to studios in North Dade, allowing Jefferson-Pilot to sell the Brickell studios to Northern Trust Bank of Florida in what marked a record for a property sale on that major thoroughfare.[53] (The building, last used by the Miami Today newspaper, was demolished in 2013.[54])\r\n\r\nRatings for the adult contemporary format declined during Jefferson-Pilot ownership as music listening continued to shift to FM, and WGBS was the last station to broadcast such a format on the AM dial.[55] In February 1983, WGBS switched to a news/talk format, with hosts including David Gold and Mike Siegel.[56] However, ratings were low throughout the run as three other stations battled it out with WGBS in that format, and by mid-1984, it was attracting ratings comparable to its prior adult contemporary sound with higher programming costs, though it was making a profit.[57]\r\nIn July 1985, Jefferson-Pilot announced it would purchase one of the direct competitors to WGBS, WNWS (790 AM), with its superior signal in Broward County and stronger ratings.[59][60] The stations worked toward a merger in November, in which four WNWS hosts and two from WGBS headed the new WNWS talk lineup.[61]\r\n\r\nBecause at the time no company could own multiple AM stations in the same area, the WGBS facility and license—though not the studios—was sold to the Mambisa Broadcasting Corporation for $3.5 million.[59] Mambisa was headed by Amancio Víctor Suárez, a 49-year-old self-made millionaire with no broadcast experience, and named for the mambises, Cuban independence fighters of the 19th century.[62] Suárez had arrived in Florida penniless as a 19-year-old, with interests in home construction and the manufacture of watches and telephone answering machines.[63]\r\n\r\nEven before full FCC approval of the underlying transfers, the merger of WGBS into WNWS became effective at noon on October 23, 1985,[64] when the call letters WGBS disappeared from Miami radio after 40 years to make way for WAQI. Temporary studios on SW 67th Avenue were used to start Radio Mambí while permanent facilities on Coral Way were built. Much like its direct format competitors—WQBA (1180 AM), WOCN (1450 AM) "Unión Radio", and WRHC (1550 AM)—Radio Mambí provided primarily news and talk programming alongside soap operas and music.[65] Unión Radio was raided heavily by the new WAQI and lost several popular personalities to the startup.[66]\r\n\r\nOne of the most attractive characteristics of the 710 facility to Mambisa was the physical plant. Whereas Jefferson-Pilot, competing for English-language listeners, wanted a signal with better Broward coverage, Mambisa got a bonus of import to its work: one of the best Miami signals into Cuba.[66][62] This fact was not lost on the Cuban government. Four days after the changeover to Radio Mambí, transmissions started for Radio Rebelde, one of Cuba\'s national radio stations, on transmitters on 710 kHz, as Radio Mambí entered what general manager Armando Pérez Roura called "a radio war with Castro" designed to block its anti-government programs from being heard in Cuba.[67] One transmitter at Santa Clara aired Rebelde, and another at Havana was noted as emitting a "high-frequency jamming buzz".[68] Rebelde The irony was that the main interference generated was not within Cuba, where station officials claimed to have a large audience, but in Florida, where high-power Radio Rebelde and WQBA signals clashed.[67] When WAQI was audible in Cuba, it offered an opposition viewpoint that reestablished contact between Cuban exiles and Cuba itself.[69]\r\n\r\nRadio Mambí rapidly became a popular station with the heavily Cuban Spanish-speaking audience in Miami by becoming the station of Cuba\'s exile community, close to the families of political prisoners and organized opposition movements while offering community service and cultural programming.[69] Suárez expanded into television with HBC, which produced the fledgling Telemundo network\'s first nightly newscast in January 1987 from Miami,[63] and, through another company, he bought FM station WTHM (98.3) in 1987[70] to relaunch it as WRTO-FM "Ritmo 98", the second full-time Spanish-language FM station in the city.[71][72]\r\n\r\nIn 1992, Radio Martí began to purchase an hour of airtime each night on WAQI and WQBA to broadcast programming to Cuba, utilizing a 1983 clause in the law that created Radio Martí permitting broadcasts over commercial stations if jamming had increased by 25 percent or more.[73] By 2007, Radio Mambí was being paid $182,500 every six months to broadcast the Radio Martí program.[74]\r\nOn June 3, 2022, Univision announced it would sell a package of 18 radio stations across 10 of its markets, primarily AM outlets in large cities (including WAQI and WQBA) and entire clusters in smaller markets such as McAllen, Texas, and Fresno, California, for $60 million to a new company known as Latino Media Network (LMN); Univision proposes to handle operations for a year under agreement before turning over operational control to LMN in the fourth quarter of 2023.[86]\r\n\r\nThe deal was immediately interpreted in a political context. Latino Media Network is headed by Stephanie Valencia, who headed Latino outreach for Barack Obama, and Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic activist, with investors and advisors including Eva Longoria, former Florida Republican Party chair Al Cárdenas, longtime television anchor María Elena Salinas, and former Miami-Dade College president Eduardo J. Padrón. Much of its funding comes from Lakestar Capital, associated with businessman and philanthropist George Soros.[87][88] Other Democratic groups had noted the prevalence of disinformation and antisemitism and the promotion of conspiracy theories, including the Great Replacement, on its air.[89] This was particularly well received by older listeners, loyal to stations like WAQI.[90] A 2021 report by media watchdogs, which focused on programs on Radio Mambí and WURN "Actualidad Radio" during one week in March 2021,[91] cited practices such as hosts not correcting callers\' incorrect statements, as well as recitations of false claims as news using sources such as Newsmax and The Daily Caller.[92] A former Univision executive told Graciela Mochkofsky of The New Yorker that Mambí\'s content was often "indefensible".[93]\r\n\r\nConservative political actors immediately feared that the change in ownership would lead to programming changes, particularly at Radio Mambí, that would marginalize their point of view. The head of Mothers Against Repression, Sylvia Iriondo, announced at a press conference held by the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, "We have grounds to be extremely concerned [...] We will resist any attempt to censor the voices of this community represented by these radio stations with all legal and legitimate means".[94] Other speakers included Florida lieutenant governor Jeanette Núñez, who recalled growing up listening to Radio Mambí in the car.[95] Six Republican lawmakers, five of them from the Florida delegation—senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, representatives Carlos A. Giménez, María Elvira Salazar, and Mario Díaz-Balart, as well as senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas—wrote a letter to FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel urging it to "thoroughly scrutinize" the transaction when filed and casting it as a "desperate" move by Democratic operatives, noting their concern over a proposed sale of WSUA (1260 AM) to ATV Holdings, which had fallen apart earlier that year.[96][97] The re-election campaign of Republican governor Ron DeSantis bought advertising time on WAQI and WQBA ($6,525 of it on WAQI[98]), airing 60-second commercials warning voters, "The left is taking control of our local media" and "they are coming with their ideological agenda", mentioning Soros "and his minions".[99] In an op-ed in the Miami Herald, Valencia and Morales Rocketto wrote of their commitment to free speech and free markets, noting that they "do not intend to change the spirit or character of what has made it popular and profitable".[100] However, several hosts departed the station, including Dania Alexandrino, Lourdes Ubieta, and Nelson Rubio, to start a new online radio station known as Americano Media, which promises to start the "first Spanish-language conservative talk radio network"; Ubieta claimed that Univision offered them and other presenters a bonus worth thousands of dollars in exchange for staying and signing a confidentiality agreement, which Pérez Castellón, who stayed, denied.[101]Viki A. Windfeldt was named the 2014 recipient of the Lorraine P. Sachs Standard of Excellence \r\nAward. This award was established in 2008 by the National Association of State Boards of \r\nAccountancy (NASBA). The Lorraine P.
